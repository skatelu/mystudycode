        <para>
            This chapter outlines the data windows that are built into Esper.
			The section on <xref linkend="processingmodel"/> provides additional information on the relationship of filtering, windows and aggregation. Please also see <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-window-spec"/> for the use of windows in the <literal>from</literal> clause with streams, patterns and named windows.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Data windows retain incoming events until an expiry policy indicates to release events. Thus data windows are a means of indicating what subset of events to analyze.
        </para>
                
        <para>
            Two or more data windows can be combined. This allows a sets of events retained by one data window to be placed into a union or an intersection with the set of events retained by one or more other data windows. Please see <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-view-multidatawindow"/> for more detail.
        </para>

        <para>
			The keep-all data window counts as a data window but has no expiry policy: it retains all events received. The grouped-window declaration allocates a new data window per grouping criteria and thereby counts as a data window, but cannot appear alone.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The next table summarizes data windows:

		   <para>
			   This example specifies a time window of 5 seconds:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#time(5 sec)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			  Esper organizes built-in data windows in namespaces and names. Windows that provide sliding or tumbling data windows are in the <literal>win</literal> namespace. Other most commonly used windows are in the <literal>std</literal> namespace. The <literal>ext</literal> namespace are window that order events. The <literal>stat</literal> namespace is used for windows that derive statistical data.
			</para>

		   <para>
			   Alternatively you may specify the namespace name and <literal>:</literal> colon character.

		   <para>
			   All expressions are allowed as parameters to data windows, including expressions that contain variables or substitution parameters for prepared statements. Subqueries, the special <literal>prior</literal> and <literal>prev</literal> functions and aggregations (with the exception of the expression window and expression batch window) are not allowed as data window parameters.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   For example, assuming a variable by name <literal>VAR_WINDOW_SIZE</literal> is defined:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#time(VAR_WINDOW_SIZE)]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   The system evaluates expression parameters for data windows at the time of context partition instantiation with the exception of the expression window (<literal>expr</literal>) and expression batch window (<literal>expr_batch</literal>). 
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   Also consider multiple data windows in intersection or union (keywords <literal>retain-intersection</literal> and <literal>retain-union</literal>). Consider writing a custom plug-in data window if your application requires behavior that is not yet provided by any of the built-in windows.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   If a window takes no parameters you may leave parenthesis off or the use empty parenthesis <literal>()</literal>.

		   <title>A Note on Batch Windows</title>
		   
		   <para>
			   Batch windows buffer events until a certain threshold is reached and then release the batched events for processing. 
			   The released events become the insert stream events and the previous batch of events constitutes the remove stream events.
			   Batch windows thus retain the current and the last batch of events in memory.
		   </para>
		   
		   <para>
			   It is often desirable to aggregate without retaining events in memory, or with just keeping the current events in memory (and not also the last batch of events). 
			   You can declare a context and define what starts and ends a "batch" instead.
			   Contexts provide a large degree of freedom in allowing batches to overlap, in allowing batches to span multiple statements and in allowing batches to have complex start and end conditions.
			   They are further described in <xref linkend="context"/>.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   This example declares a non-overlapping context that spans a time interval of 3 seconds (i.e. a batch of 3 seconds):
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create context IntervalSpanning3Seconds start @now end after 3 sec]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   The next example EPL aggregates events without retaining events in memory and outputs at the end of each interval:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[context IntervalSpanning3Seconds select count(*) from Events output snapshot when terminated]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Here is an example that outputs all events when at least 10 events, in the 3-second interval, have collected:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[context IntervalSpanning3Seconds select window(*) from Events#keepall having count(*) >= 10]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				For the examples above, at the end of each 3-second interval, the engine discards all data windows and aggregation state.
				If your application would like 3-second intervals keyed by some fields please consider a nested context declaration with a keyed segmented context, for example:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create context PerSymbolInterval3Sec 
  context ById partition by symbol from StockTick, 
  context Interval3Sec start @now end after 3 sec]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Batch windows keep not only the current batch in memory but also the previous batch of events. 
				For example, let's say at time 0 an event arrives and enters the batch window. 
				At time 3 seconds (3-second batch window) the event becomes an insert-stream event and the engine now updates aggregations for that batch (i.e. count goes up to 1). 
				At time 6 seconds the event becomes a remove-stream event and the engine now updates aggregations for that batch (i.e. count goes down to 0).
				Since the engine continually updates aggregations from insert and remove stream events, and does not re-compute aggregations, batch windows follow the same paradigm.

				<para>
					Similar to the time window, this window is a moving (sliding) time window extending the specified time interval into the past, but based on the long-type
					time value supplied by a timestamp expression. The window takes two parameters: the expression to return long-typed timestamp values,
					and a time period or expression that provides a number of seconds:
				</para>

				<synopsis>ext_timed(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>time_period</emphasis>)</synopsis>
				<synopsis>ext_timed(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>seconds_interval_expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The key difference comparing the externally-timed window to the regular time window is that the window slides not based on the engine time, 
					but strictly based on the result of the timestamp expression when evaluated against the events entering the window.
				</para>

				<para>
					The algorithm underlying the window compares the timestamp value returned by the expression when the oldest event arrived with the timestamp value returned by the expression for the newest arriving event on event arrival. 
					If the time interval between the timestamp values is larger then the timer period parameter, 
					then the algorithm removes all oldest events tail-first until the difference between the oldest and newest event is within the time interval. The window
					therefore slides only when events arrive and only considers each event's timestamp property (or other expression value returned) and not engine time.
				</para>

				<para>
					This window holds stock tick events of the last 10 seconds based on the timestamp property in <literal>StockTickEvent</literal>.
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#ext_timed(timestamp, 10 seconds)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The externally-timed data window expects strict ordering of the timestamp values returned by the timestamp expression. The window is not useful for ordering events in time order, please use the time-order window instead.
				</para>
				
				<para>
				  On a related subject, engine time itself can be entirely under control of the application as described in <xref linkend="api-controlling-time"/>, allowing control over all time-based aspects of processing
				  in one place.

				<indexterm><primary>data window</primary><secondary>time batch window</secondary></indexterm>

				<para>
					This window buffers events (tumbling window) and releases them every specified time interval in one update. The window takes a time period or an expression providing a number of seconds as a parameter, plus optional parameters described next.
				</para>

				<synopsis>time_batch(<emphasis>time_period</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>] [,<emphasis>flow_control</emphasis>])</synopsis>
				<synopsis>time_batch(<emphasis>seconds_interval_expression</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>] [,<emphasis>flow_control</emphasis>])</synopsis>

				<para>
					The time batch window takes a second, optional parameter that serves as a reference point to batch flush times. If not specified, the arrival of the first event into the batch window sets the 
					reference point. Therefore if the reference point is not specified and the first event arrives at time t<subscript>1</subscript>, then the batch flushes at time t<subscript>1</subscript> plus <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> and every <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> thereafter.
				</para>

				<note>
					<para>
						Please see <xref linkend="view-batchwindows"/> for information on what a batch window is and how to best to compute over intervals. 
					</para>
					<para>
						Note that using this window means that the engine keeps events in memory until the time is up: Consider your event arrival rate and determine if this is the behavior you want. Use context declaration or output rate limiting such as <literal>output snapshot</literal> as an alternative.
					</para>	
				</note>

				<para>
					The below example batches events into a 5 second window releasing new batches every 5 seconds. Listeners to updates
					posted by this window receive updated information only every 5 seconds.
				</para>	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#time_batch(5 sec)]]></programlisting>
								
				<para>
					By default, if there are no events arriving in the current interval (insert stream), and no events remain from the prior batch (remove stream), then the window does not post results to listeners. The window allows overriding this
					default behavior via flow control keywords.
				</para>

				<para>
					The synopsis with flow control parameters is:
				</para>
				<synopsis>time_batch(<emphasis>time_period or seconds_interval_expr</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>] 
    [, "flow-control-keyword [, keyword...]"] )</synopsis>

				<para>
					The FORCE_UPDATE flow control keyword instructs the window to post an empty result set to listeners if there is no
					data to post for an interval. When using this keyword the <literal>irstream</literal> keyword should be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause to ensure the remove stream is also output. 
					Note that FORCE_UPDATE is for use with listeners to the same statement and not for use with named windows. Consider output rate limiting instead.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The START_EAGER flow control keyword instructs the window to post empty result sets even before the first event
					arrives, starting a time interval at statement creation time. As when using FORCE_UPDATE, the window also posts an
					empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval, however it starts doing so at time of statement
					creation rather then at the time of arrival of the first event.
				</para>

				<para>
					Taking the two flow control keywords in one sample statement, this example presents a window that waits for 10
					seconds. It posts empty result sets after one interval after the statement is created, and keeps posting an empty result set as no events arrive during intervals:					
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent#time_batch(10 sec, "FORCE_UPDATE, START_EAGER")]]></programlisting>

				<para>
				    Similar to the time batch window, this window buffers events (tumbling) and releases them every specified time interval in one update, 
				    but based on the long-type time value supplied by a timestamp expression.
					The window has two required parameters taking an expression that returns long-typed timestamp values and a time period or constant-value expression that provides a number of seconds:
				</para>

				<synopsis>ext_timed_batch(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>])</synopsis>
				<synopsis>ext_timed_batch(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>seconds_interval_expression</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>])</synopsis>

				<para>
					The externally-timed batch window takes a third, optional parameter that serves as a reference point to batch flush times. If not specified, the arrival of the first event into the batch window sets the 
					reference point. Therefore if the reference point is not specified and the first event arrives at time t<subscript>1</subscript>, then the batch flushes at time t<subscript>1</subscript> plus <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> and every <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> thereafter.
				</para>

				<para>
				   The key difference comparing the externally-timed batch window to the regular time batch window is that the window tumbles not based on the engine time, 
				   but strictly based on the result of the timestamp expression when evaluated against the events entering the window.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The algorithm underlying the window compares the timestamp value returned by the expression when the oldest event arrived with the timestamp value returned by the expression for the 
					newest arriving event on event arrival. If the time interval between the timestamp values is larger then the timer period parameter, then the algorithm posts the current batch of events. 
					The window therefore posts batches only when events arrive and only considers each event's timestamp property (or other expression value returned) and not engine time.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					Note that using this window means that the engine keeps events in memory until the time is up: Consider your event arrival rate and determine if this is the behavior you want. Use context declaration or output rate limiting such as <literal>output snapshot</literal> as an alternative.
				</para>

				<para>
					The below example batches events into a 5 second window releasing new batches every 5 seconds. Listeners to updates
					posted by this window receive updated information only when event arrive with timestamps that indicate the start of a new batch:

				<para>
					This data window is a combination of time and length batch (tumbling) windows. Similar to the time and length batch windows, this batches events and releases the batched events when either one of the 
following conditions occurs, whichever occurs first: the data window has collected a given number of events, or a given time interval has passed.
				</para>

				<para>
					The parameters take 2 forms. The first form accepts a time period or an expression providing a number of seconds, and an expression for the number of events:
				</para>				
				<synopsis>time_length_batch(<emphasis>time_period</emphasis>, <emphasis>number_of_events_expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>
				<synopsis>time_length_batch(<emphasis>seconds_interval_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>number_of_events_expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The next example shows a time-length combination batch window that batches up to 100 events or all events arriving within a 1-second time interval, whichever condition occurs first:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[ select * from MyEvent#time_length_batch(1 sec, 100)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					In this example, if 100 events arrive into the window before a 1-second time interval passes, the window posts the batch of 100 events. If less then 100 events arrive within a 1-second interval,
					the window posts all events that arrived within the 1-second interval at the end of the interval.
				</para>

				<para>
					By default, if there are no events arriving in the current interval (insert stream), and no events remain from the prior batch (remove stream), then the window does not post results to listeners. This
					window allows overriding this default behavior via flow control keywords.
				</para>

				<para>
					The synopsis of the window with flow control parameters is:
				</para>				
				<synopsis>time_length_batch(<emphasis>time_period or seconds_interval_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>number_of_events_expression</emphasis>, 
    "<emphasis>flow control keyword [, keyword...]</emphasis>")</synopsis>

				<para>
					The <literal>FORCE_UPDATE</literal> flow control keyword instructs the window to post an empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval. The window begins posting no later then after one time interval passed after the first event arrives. When using this keyword the <literal>irstream</literal> keyword should be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause to ensure the remove stream is also output. 
				</para>				

				<para>
					The <literal>START_EAGER</literal> flow control keyword instructs the window to post empty result sets even before the first event arrives, starting a time interval at statement creation time. As when using <literal>FORCE_UPDATE</literal>, the window also posts an empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval, however it starts doing so at time of statement creation rather then at the time of arrival of the first event.
				</para>				

				<para>
					Taking the two flow control keywords in one sample statement, this example presents a window that waits for 10 seconds or reacts when the 5th event arrives, whichever comes first. It posts empty result sets after one interval after the statement is created, and keeps posting an empty result set as no events arrive during intervals:

				</para>

				<para>
					When a new event arrives or when a variable value referenced by the expiry expression changes then the window applies the expiry expression starting from the oldest event in the data window.
					If the expiry expression returns false for the oldest event, the window removes the event from the data window. The window then applies the expression to the next oldest event.
					If the expiry expression returns true for the oldest event, no further evaluation takes place and the window indicates any new and expired events through insert and remove stream.

					Specifying <literal>#groupwin</literal> groups events into sub-data-window by the value returned by the specified expression or the combination of values returned by a list of expressions. The <literal>#groupwin</literal> takes a single expression to supply the group criteria values, or a list of expressions as parameters, as the synopsis shows:
				</para>

				<synopsis>groupwin(<emphasis>grouping_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>grouping_expression</emphasis> ...])</synopsis>

				<para>
					The <emphasis>grouping_expression</emphasis> expression(s) return one or more group keys, by which it creates a separate data window for each distinct group key. Note that the expression should not return an unlimited number of values: the grouping expression should not
					return a time value or otherwise unlimited key. 
				</para>

				<para>
					An expression may return a <literal>null</literal> value. The engine treats a <literal>null</literal> value as any other value. An expression can also return a custom application object, whereby the application class should implement the <literal>hashCode</literal> and <literal>equals</literal> methods.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					You can specify a single <literal>groupwin</literal> per stream. Multiple <literal>groupwin</literal> declarations for the same stream are not allowed.
				</para>

				<para>
					Use <literal>group by</literal> instead of the grouped data window to control how aggregations are grouped.
				</para>

				<para>
					A grouped data window with a length window of 1 is equivalent to the unique data window <literal>unique</literal>. The <literal>unique</literal> data window is the preferred notation:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#unique(symbol)	// Prefer this
// ... equivalent to ...
select * from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(1)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					This example computes the total price for the last 5 events considering the last 5 events per each symbol, aggregating the price across all symbols (since no <literal>group by</literal> clause is specified the aggregation is across all symbols):
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(5)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The @Hint("<literal>reclaim_group_aged=</literal><emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis>") hint instructs the engine to discard grouped data window state that has not been updated for <emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis> seconds. 
					The optional @Hint("<literal>reclaim_group_freq=</literal><emphasis>sweep_frequency_in_seconds</emphasis>") can be specified in addition to control the frequency at which the engine sweeps data window state.
					If the hint is not specified, the frequency defaults to the same value as <emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis>. Use the hints when your group criteria returns a changing or unlimited number of values. By default and without hints the data window does not reclaim or remove data windows for group criteria values.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The updated sample statement with both hints:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[// Remove data window for symbols not updated for 10 seconds or more and sweep every 30 seconds
@Hint('reclaim_group_aged=10,reclaim_group_freq=30')
select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(5)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Reclaim executes when an event arrives and not in the timer thread. In the example above reclaim can occur up to 40 seconds of engine time after the newest event arrives.
					Reclaim may affect iteration order for the statement and iteration order becomes indeterministic with reclaim.
				</para>

				<para>
					To compute the total price for the last 5 events considering the last 5 events per each symbol and outputting a price per symbol, add the <literal>group by</literal> clause:
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(5) group by symbol]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The <literal>groupwin</literal> grouped-window can also take multiple expressions that provide values to group by. This example computes the total price for each symbol and feed for the last 10 events per symbol and feed combination:
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol, feed)#length(10)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The order in which the <literal>groupwin</literal> grouped-window appears controls the data the engine derives from events for each group. The next 2 statements demonstrate this using a length window.
				</para>

				<para>
					Without the <literal>groupwin</literal> declaration query the same query returns the total price per symbol for only the last 10 events across all symbols. Here the engine allocates only one length window for all events:
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#length(10)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					We have learned that by placing the <literal>groupwin</literal> grouped-window before other data windows, these other data windows become part of the grouped set of windows. The engine dynamically allocates a new window instance for each, every time it encounters a new group key such as a new value for symbol. Therefore, in <literal>groupwin(symbol)#length(10)</literal> the engine allocates a new length window for each distinct symbol. However in <literal>length(10)</literal> alone the engine maintains a single length window.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>groupwin</literal> can be used with multiple data windows to achieve a grouped intersection or union policy.
				</para>

				<para>
					The next query retains the last 4 events per symbol and only those events that are also not older then 10 seconds:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(4)#time(10)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Last, considers a grouped data window for two group criteria. Here, the query results are total price per symbol and feed for the last 100 events per symbol and feed.
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol, feed)#length(100)]]></programlisting>
		
				<note>
					<para>
					  A note on grouped time windows: When using grouped-window with time windows, note that whether the engine retains 5 minutes of events or retains 5 minutes of events per group, the result is the same from the perspective of retaining events as both policies retain, considering all groups, the same set of events. Therefore please specify the time window alone (ungrouped).
					</para>
					<para>
						For example:
					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[// Use this:
select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#time(1 minute)

// is equivalent to (don't use this):
// select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#time(1 minute)

// Use the group-by clause for grouping aggregation by symbol.]]></programlisting>
				</note>

				<para>
					For advanced users: There is an optional declaration that can control how the <literal>groupwin</literal> grouped-window gets evaluated and that is <literal>#merge</literal>. 
					The merge can only occur after a <literal>groupwin</literal> grouped-window. It controls the end of the grouped declaration. 
				</para>

				<para>
					Compare the following statements:
				</para>
				
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from Market#groupwin(ticker)#length(1000000)
    #weighted_avg(price, volume)#merge(ticker)
// ... and ...
select * from Market#groupwin(ticker)#length(1000000)#merge(ticker)
    #weighted_avg(price, volume)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					If your statement does not specify the optional <literal>#merge</literal>, the semantics are the same as the first statement.
				</para>

				<para>
					The first statement, in which the <literal>#merge</literal>is added to the end (same as no merge), computes weighted average per ticker, considering, per-ticker, the last 1M Market events for each ticker.
					The second statement, in which the merge is added to the middle, computes weighted average considering, per-ticker, the last 1M Market events, computing the weighted average for all such events using a single data window rather then multiple data window instances with one window per ticker.

				<para>
					This window orders events that arrive out-of-order, using timestamp-values provided by an expression, and by comparing that timestamp value to engine time.
				</para>

				<para>
					The syntax for this window is as follows.
				</para>
				<synopsis>time_order(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>time_period</emphasis>)</synopsis>
				<synopsis>time_order(<emphasis>timestamp_expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>seconds_interval_expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The first parameter to the window is the expression that supplies timestamp values. The timestamp is expected to be a long-typed value that denotes an event's time of consideration by the window (or other expression). This is typically the time of arrival. The second parameter is a number-of-seconds expression or the time period specifying the time interval that an arriving event should maximally be held, in order to consider older events arriving at a later time.
				</para>

				<para>
					Since the window compares timestamp values to engine time, the window requires that the timestamp values and engine time are both following the same clock. Therefore, to the extend that the clocks that originated both timestamps differ, the window may produce inaccurate results.
				</para>

				<para>
					As an example, the next statement uses the <literal>arrival_time</literal> property of <literal>MyTimestampedEvent</literal> events to order and release events by arrival time:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[insert rstream into ArrivalTimeOrderedStream
select rstream * from MyTimestampedEvent#time_order(arrival_time, 10 sec)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					In the example above, the <literal>arrival_time</literal> property holds a long-typed timestamp value. On arrival of an event, the engine compares the timestamp value of each event to the tail-time of the window. The tail-time of the window is, in this example, 10 seconds before engine time (continuously sliding). If the timestamp value indicates that the event is older then the tail-time of the time window, the event is released immediately in the remove stream. If the timestamp value indicates that the event is newer then the tail-time of the window, the window retains the event until engine time moves such that the event timestamp is older then tail-time.
				</para> 

				<para>
					The examples thus holds each arriving event in memory anywhere from zero seconds to 10 seconds, to allow for older events (considering arrival time timestamp) to arrive. In other words, the window holds an event with an arrival time equal to engine time for 10 seconds. The window holds an event with an arrival time that is 2 seconds older then engine time for 8 seconds. The window holds an event with an arrival time that is 10 or more seconds older then engine time for zero seconds, and releases such (old) events immediately into the remove stream. 
				</para> 

				<para>
					The insert stream of this sliding window consists of all arriving events. The remove stream of the window is ordered by timestamp value: The event that has the oldest timestamp value is released first, followed by the next newer events. Note the statement above uses the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword in both the <literal>insert into</literal> clause and the <literal>select</literal> clause to select ordered events only. It uses the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to makes such ordered stream available for subsequent statements to use.
				</para> 

				<para>
					It is up to your application to populate the timestamp property into your events or use a sensible expression that returns timestamp values for consideration by the window. The window also works well if you use externally-provided time via timer events.

			   The derived-value windows can be used combined with data windows or alone. Very similar to aggregation functions, these windows aggregate or derive information from an event stream. As compared to aggregation functions,
			   statistics windows can post multiple derived fields all-in-one including properties from the last event that was received. The derived fields and event properties are available for querying in the <literal>where</literal>-clause and are often compared to prior values using the <literal>prior</literal> function. Derived-value window do not retain events.

				</para>

				<synopsis>size([<emphasis>expression</emphasis>, ...] [ * ])</synopsis>

				<para>					
					The window posts a single long-typed property named <literal>size</literal>. The window posts the prior size as old data, and the current size as new data to update listeners of the window. Via the <literal>iterator</literal> method of the statement the size value can also be polled (read). The window only posts output events when the <literal>size</literal> count changes and does not stay the same.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					As optional parameters the window takes a list of expressions that the window evaluates against the last arriving event and provides along the <literal>size</literal> field. You may also provide the <literal>*</literal> wildcard selector to have the window output all event properties.
				</para>

				<para>					
					An alternative to receiving a data window event count is the <literal>prevcount</literal> function. Compared to the <literal>size</literal> window the <literal>prevcount</literal> function requires a data window while the <literal>size</literal> window does not. The related <literal>count(...)</literal> aggregation function provides a count per group when used with <literal>group by</literal>.
				</para>

				<para>
					When combined with a data window, the size window  reports the current number of events in the data window in the insert stream and the prior number of events in the data window as the remove stream. This example reports the number of tick events within the last 1 minute:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select size from StockTickEvent#time(1 min)#size]]></programlisting>
