        <title>EPL Introduction</title>

        <para>
			The Event Processing Language (EPL) is a SQL-standard language with extensions, offering <literal>SELECT</literal>, <literal>FROM</literal>, <literal>WHERE</literal>, <literal>GROUP BY</literal>, <literal>HAVING</literal> and <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clauses. Streams replace tables as the source of data with events replacing rows as the basic unit of data. Since events are composed of data, the SQL concepts of correlation through joins, subqueries and aggregation through grouping can be effectively leveraged.
        </para>

        <para>
			The <literal>INSERT INTO</literal> clause is recast as a means of forwarding events to other streams for further processing. External data may be queried and joined with the stream data. Additional clauses such as the <literal>PATTERN</literal> and <literal>OUTPUT</literal> clauses are available to provide the missing SQL language constructs specific to event processing.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			EPL statements can specify data windows. Similar to tables in a SQL statement, data windows define the subset of events to be analyzed. 
            Data windows can be combined to an intersection or union of sets of events.
            Some of the often-used data windows are <literal>#length</literal>, <literal>#time</literal>, <literal>#unique</literal>, <literal>#lastevent</literal>, <literal>#firstevent</literal> and <literal>#keepall</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			EPL provides the concept of <emphasis>named window</emphasis>. Named windows are data windows that can be used by multiple statements. 
			The name of a named window can occur in a statement's <literal>FROM</literal> clause to query the named window or to include the named window in a join or subquery. 
        </para>

        <para>
			EPL provides the concept of <emphasis>table</emphasis>. Tables are globally-visible data structures that typically have primary key columns and that can hold aggregation state. 
			An overview of named windows and tables, and a comparison between them, can be found at <xref linkend="nwtable-overview"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
			EPL allows execution of on-demand (fire-and-forget, non-continuous, triggered by API) queries against named windows and tables through the runtime API. The query engine automatically indexes named window data for fast access by <literal>ON SELECT/MERGE/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE</literal> without the need to create an index explicitly, or can access explicit (secondary) table indexes for operations on tables. For fast on-demand query execution via runtime API use the <literal>CREATE INDEX</literal> syntax to create an explicit index for the named window or table in question.
        </para>

        <para>
			Use <literal>CREATE SCHEMA</literal> to declare an event type.
        </para>

        <para>
			<emphasis>Variables</emphasis> can come in handy to parameterize statements and change parameters on-the-fly and in response to events. Variables can be used in an expression anywhere in a statement as well as in the output clause for dynamic control of output rates.
        </para>

        <para>
			Esper can be extended by plugging-in custom developed data windows, aggregation functions, and more.
        </para>

    <sect1 xml:id="epl-select-syntax">
        <title>EPL Syntax</title>
        
		<para>
			EPL queries are created and stored in the engine, and publish results to listeners as events are received by the engine or timer events occur that match the criteria specified in the query. Events can also be obtained from running EPL queries via the <literal>safeIterator</literal> and <literal>iterator</literal> methods that provide a pull-data API.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies the event properties or events to retrieve. The <literal>from</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies the event stream definitions and stream names to use. The <literal>where</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies search conditions that specify which event or event combination to search for. For example, the following statement returns the average price for IBM stock ticks in the last 30 seconds.
		</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select avg(price) from StockTick#time(30 sec) where symbol='IBM']]></programlisting>

		<para>
			EPL queries follow the below syntax. EPL queries can be simple queries or more complex queries. A simple select contains only a <literal>select</literal> clause and a single stream definition. Complex EPL queries can be build that feature a more elaborate select list utilizing expressions, may join multiple streams, may contain a <literal>where</literal> clause with search conditions and so on.

			<para>
				Certain words such as <literal>select</literal>, <literal>delete</literal> or <literal>set</literal> are reserved and may not be used as identifiers. Please consult <xref linkend="appendix_keywords"/> for the list of reserved keywords and permitted keywords.
			</para>

			<para>
				Names of built-in functions and certain auxiliary keywords are permitted as event property names and in the rename syntax of the <literal>select</literal> clause. For example, <literal>count</literal> is acceptable.

				Consider the example below, which assumes that <literal>'last'</literal> is an event property of MyEvent:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// valid

			<para>
				This example shows an incorrect use of a reserved keyword:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// invalid
select insert from MyEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				EPL offers an escape syntax for reserved keywords: Event properties as well as event or stream names may be escaped via the backwards apostrophe <literal>`</literal> (ASCII 96) character.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example queries an event type by name <literal>Order</literal> (a reserved keyword) that provides a property by name <literal>insert</literal> (a reserved keyword):

			<para>
				You may surround string values by either double-quotes (<literal>"</literal>) or single-quotes (<literal>'</literal>). When your string constant in an EPL statement itself contains double quotes or single quotes,
				you must escape the quotes.
			</para>

			<para>
				Double and single quotes may be escaped by the backslash (<literal>\</literal>) character or by unicode notation. Unicode 0027 is a single quote (<literal>'</literal>) and 0022 is a double quote (<literal>"</literal>).
			</para>

			<para>
			  Escaping event property names is described in <xref linkend="eventrep-properties-escaping"/>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL below escapes the single quote in the string constant <literal>John's</literal>, and filters out order events where the name value matches:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from OrderEvent(name='John\'s')
// ...equivalent to...
select * from OrderEvent(name='John\u0027s')]]></programlisting>

			<para>

           <title>Using Constants and Enum Types</title>
			<indexterm><primary>constants</primary></indexterm>
			<indexterm><primary>enum types</primary></indexterm>
			<para>
				This chapter is about Java language constants and enum types and their use in EPL expressions. 
			</para>
			<para>
				Java language constants are public static final fields in Java that may participate in expressions of all kinds, as this example shows:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where property = MyConstantClass.FIELD_VALUE]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				Event properties that are enumeration values can be compared by their enum type value:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where enumProp = EnumClass.ENUM_VALUE_1]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				Event properties can also be passed to enum type functions or compared to an enum type method result:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where somevalue = EnumClass.ENUM_VALUE_1.getSomeValue()
  or EnumClass.ENUM_VALUE_2.analyze(someothervalue)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Enum types have a <literal>valueOf</literal> method that returns the enum type value:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where enumProp = EnumClass.valueOf('ENUM_VALUE_1')]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				If your application does not import, through configuration, the package that contains the enumeration class, then it must also specify the package name of the class. Enum types that are inner classes must be qualified with <literal>$</literal> following Java conventions.
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, the Color enum type as an inner class to <literal>MyEvent</literal> in package <literal>org.myorg</literal> can be referenced as shown:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent(enumProp=org.myorg.MyEvent$Color.GREEN)#firstevent]]></programlisting>

		<sect2 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation">
			<title>Annotation</title>
			<indexterm><primary>annotation</primary></indexterm>

			<para>
				An annotation is an addition made to information in a statement. Esper provides certain built-in annotations for defining statement name, adding a statement description or for tagging statements such as for managing statements or directing statement output. 
				Other than the built-in annotations, applications can provide their own annotation classes that the EPL compiler can populate.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				An annotation is part of the statement text and precedes the EPL select or pattern statement. Annotations are therefore part of the EPL grammar. The syntax for annotations follows the host language (Java, .NET) annotation syntax:
			</para>
			<synopsis>@<emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> [(<emphasis>annotation_parameters</emphasis>)]</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				An annotation consists of the annotation name and optional annotation parameters. The <emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> is the simple class name or fully-qualified class name of the annotation class. The optional <emphasis>annotation_parameters</emphasis> 
				are a list of key-value pairs following the syntax:
			</para>
			<synopsis>@<emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> (<emphasis>attribute_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>attribute_value</emphasis>, [name=value, ...])</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				The <emphasis>attribute_name</emphasis> is an identifier that must match the attributes defined by the annotation class. An <emphasis>attribute_value</emphasis> is a constant of any of the primitive types or string, an array, an enum type value or another (nested) annotation. Null values are not allowed as annotation attribute values. Enumeration values are supported in EPL statements and not support in statements created via the <literal>createPattern</literal> method.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Use the <literal>getAnnotations</literal> method of <literal>EPStatement</literal> to obtain annotations provided via statement text.

				</para>

				<para>
					The name of application-provided annotations is case-sensitive.

				<para>
					To enable the engine to recognize application annotation classes, your annotation name must include the package name (i.e. be fully-qualified) or your engine configuration must import the annotation class or package via the configuration API.  
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, assume that your application defines an annotation in its application code as follows:

					Above example assumes the <literal>ProcessMonitor</literal> annotation class is imported via configuration XML or API. 					
				</para>
				
				<para>
					If <literal>ProcessMonitor</literal> should only be visible for use in annotations, use <literal>addAnnotationImport</literal> (or the <literal>auto-import-annotations</literal> XML tag).

@Tag(name="grouping", value="customer")

select customerId, sum(revenue) from CustomerRevenueEvent]]></programlisting>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation-name">
				<title>@Name</title>
				<para>
					Use the @Name EPL annotation to specify a statement name within the EPL statement itself, as an alternative to specifying the statement name via API.
				</para>
				<para>
					If your application is also providing a statement name through the API, the statement name provided through the API overrides the annotation-provided statement name.
				</para>	
				<para>
					Example:
				</para>	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[@Name("SecurityFilter1") select * from SecurityFilter(ip="127.0.0.1")]]></programlisting>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation-description">
				<title>@Description</title>
				<para>
					Use the @Description EPL annotation to add a statement textual description.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example:
				</para>	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[@Description('This statement filters localhost.') select * from SecurityFilter(ip="127.0.0.1")]]></programlisting>

					Use the @Tag EPL annotation to tag statements with name-value pairs, effectively adding a property to the statement. The attributes <literal>name</literal> and <literal>value</literal> are of type string.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example:
				</para>	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[@Tag(name='ip_sensitive', value='Y') 
@Tag(name='author', value='Jim')

			<sect3 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation-priority">
				<title>@Priority</title>
				<para>
					This annotation only takes effect if the engine-level setting for prioritized execution is set via configuration, as described in <xref linkend="config-engine-execution"/>.
				</para>

				<para>
					Use the @Priority EPL annotation to tag statements with a priority value. The default priority value is zero (0) for all statements. When an event (or single timer execution) requires processing the event for multiple statements, processing begins with the highest priority statement and ends with the lowest-priority statement.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example:
				</para>	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[@Priority(10) select * from SecurityFilter(ip="127.0.0.1")]]></programlisting>

			<sect3 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation-drop">
				<title>@Drop</title>
				<para>
					This annotation only takes effect if the engine-level setting for prioritized execution is set via configuration, as described in <xref linkend="config-engine-execution"/>.
				</para>

				<para>
					Use the @Drop EPL annotation to tag statements that preempt all other same or lower-priority statements. When an event (or single timer execution) requires processing the event for multiple statements, processing begins with the highest priority statement and ends with the first statement marked with @Drop, which becomes the last statement to process that event.
				</para>

				<para>
					Unless a different priority is specified, the statement with the @Drop EPL annotation executes at priority 1. Thereby @Drop alone is an effective means to remove events from a stream.
				</para>

			<sect3 xml:id="epl-syntax-annotation-hint">
				<title>@Hint</title>
				<para>
					A hint can be used to provide tips for the engine to affect statement execution. Hints change performance or memory-use of a statement but generally do not change its output.
				</para>

			<title>Expression Alias</title>
			<indexterm><primary>expression alias</primary></indexterm>
			<indexterm><primary>lambda</primary><secondary>expression alias</secondary></indexterm>

			<para>
				An expression alias simply assigns a name to an expression. The alias name can be used in other expressions to refer to that expression, without the need to duplicate the expression.
			</para>

			<para>
				The expression alias obtains its scope from where it is used. Parameters cannot be provided. 
				A second means to sharing expressions is the expression declaration as described next, which allows passing parameters and is more tightly scoped.
			</para>

			<para>
				An EPL statement can contain and refer to any number of expression aliases. 
			    For expressions aliases that are visible across multiple EPL statements please consult <xref linkend="create-exprglobal-alias"/> 
			    that explains the <literal>create expression</literal> clause.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				The syntax for an expression alias is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>expression <emphasis>expression_name</emphasis> <literal>alias for { </literal><emphasis>expression</emphasis> <literal>}</literal></synopsis>
			
			<para>
				An expression alias consists of the expression name and an expression in curly braces.
				The return type of the expression is determined by the engine and need not be specified. 
				The scope is automatic and determined by where the alias name is used therefore parameters cannot be specified.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This example declares an expression alias <literal>twoPI</literal> that substitutes <literal>Math.PI * 2</literal>:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression twoPI alias for { Math.PI * 2 }
select twoPI from SampleEvent]]></programlisting>

			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression countPeople alias for { count(*) }
select countPeople from EnterRoomEvent#time(10 seconds) having countPeople > 10]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				An EPL statement can contain expression declarations. Expressions that are common to multiple places in the same EPL statement can be moved to a named expression declaration and reused within the same statement without duplicating the expression itself.
			</para>
						
			<para>
			    For declaring expressions that are visible across multiple EPL statements i.e. globally visible expressions please consult <xref linkend="create-exprglobal-expr"/>

			<para>
			    The engine may cache declared expression result values and reuse cache values, see <xref linkend="config-engine-execution-declaredexprvaluecachesize"/>.
			</para>

			<para>
				An expression declaration follows the lambda-style expression syntax. This syntax was chosen as it typically allows for a shorter and more concise expression body that can be easier to read then most procedural code. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The syntax for an expression declaration is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>expression <emphasis>expression_name</emphasis> { <emphasis>expression_body</emphasis> }</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				An expression declaration consists of the expression name and an expression body. The <emphasis>expression_name</emphasis> is any identifier. The <emphasis>expression_body</emphasis> contains optional parameters and the expression.
				The parameter types and the return type of the expression is determined by the engine and do not need to be specified.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Parameters to a declared expression can be a stream name, pattern tag name or wildcard (<literal>*</literal>). Use wildcard to pass the event itself to the expression. In a join or subquery, or more generally in an expression where multiple streams or pattern tags are available, the EPL must specify the stream name or pattern tag name and cannot use wildcard.
			</para>
		
			<para>
				In the expression body the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator reads as "goes to" (<literal>-&gt;</literal> may be used and is equivalent). The left side of the lambda operator specifies the input parameters (if any) and the right side holds the expression. The lambda expression <literal>x => x * x</literal> is read "x goes to x times x".
			</para>
		
			<para>
				In the expression body, if your expression takes no parameters, you may simply specify the expression and do not need the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				If your expression takes one parameters, specify the input parameter name followed by the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator and followed by the expression. The synopsis for use with a single input parameter is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>expression_body:   <emphasis>input_param_name</emphasis> => <emphasis>expression</emphasis> </synopsis>
			
			<para>
				If your expression takes two or more parameters, specify the input parameter names in parenthesis followed by the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator followed by the expression. The synopsis for use with a multiple input parameter is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>expression_body:   (<emphasis>input_param</emphasis> [,<emphasis>input_param</emphasis> [,...]]) => <emphasis>expression</emphasis> </synopsis>

			<para>
				The following example declares an expression that returns two times PI (ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter) and demonstrates its use in a select-clause:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression twoPI { Math.PI * 2} select twoPI() from SampleEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The parentheses are optional when the expression accepts no parameters. The below is equivalent to the previous example:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression twoPI { Math.PI * 2} select twoPI from SampleEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example declares an expression that accepts one parameter: a MarketData event. The expression computes a new "mid" price based on the buy and sell price:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression midPrice { x => (x.buy + x.sell) / 2 } 
select midPrice(md) from MarketDataEvent as md]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The variable name can be left off if event property names resolve without ambiguity.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This example EPL removes the variable name <literal>x</literal>:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression midPrice { x => (buy + sell) / 2 } 
select midPrice(md) from MarketDataEvent as md]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example EPL specifies wildcard instead:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression midPrice { x => (buy + sell) / 2 } 
select midPrice(*) from MarketDataEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				A further example that demonstrates two parameters is listed next. The example joins two streams and uses the price value from MarketDataEvent and the sentiment value of NewsEvent to compute a weighted sentiment:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression weightedSentiment { (x, y) => x.price * y.sentiment } 
select weightedSentiment(md, news) 
from MarketDataEvent#lastevent as md, NewsEvent#lastevent news]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Any expression can be used in the expression body including aggregations, variables, subqueries or further declared or alias expressions. Sub-queries, when used without <literal>in</literal> or <literal>exists</literal>, must be placed within parenthesis.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			    An example subquery within an expression declaration is shown next:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[expression newsSubq { md -> 
    (select sentiment from NewsEvent#unique(symbol) where symbol = md.symbol)

        <title>Choosing Event Properties and Events: The <emphasis>Select</emphasis> Clause</title>
        
		<indexterm><primary>select clause</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>EPL</primary><secondary>select clause</secondary></indexterm>
		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause is required in all EPL statements. The <literal>select</literal> clause can be used to select all properties via the wildcard <literal>*</literal>, or to specify a list of event properties and expressions. The <literal>select</literal> clause defines the event type (event property names and types) of the resulting events published by the statement, or pulled from the statement via the iterator methods.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause also offers optional <literal>istream</literal>, <literal>irstream</literal> and <literal>rstream</literal> keywords to control whether input stream, remove stream or input and remove stream events are posted to <literal>UpdateListener</literal> instances and observers to a statement. By default, the engine provides only the insert stream to listener and observers. See <xref linkend="config-engine-stream-selection"/> on how to change the default.
		</para>

		<para>
			The syntax for the <literal>select</literal> clause is summarized below.
		</para>

		<synopsis>select [istream | irstream | rstream] [distinct] * | <emphasis>expression_list</emphasis> ... </synopsis>

		<para>
			The <literal>istream</literal> keyword is the default, and indicates that the engine only delivers insert stream events to listeners and observers. The <literal>irstream</literal> keyword indicates that the engine delivers both insert and remove stream. Finally, the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword tells the engine to deliver only the remove stream.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>distinct</literal> keyword outputs only unique rows depending on the column list you have specified after it. It must occur after the <literal>select</literal> and after the optional stream keywords, as described in more detail below.
		</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="epl-select-all-props" >
           <title>Choosing the Event Itself: Select *</title>

			<para>
				The syntax for selecting the event itself is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>select * from <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis></synopsis>

			<para>
				The following statement selects StockTick events for the last 30 seconds of IBM stock ticks.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTick(symbol='IBM')#time(30 sec)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			  You may well be asking: Why does the statement specify a time window here? First, the statement is meant to demonstrate the use of <literal>*</literal> wildcard. 
			  When the engine pushes statement results to your listener and as the statement does not select remove stream events via <literal>rstream</literal> keyword, the listener receives only new events and the time window could be left off.
			  By adding the time window the pull API (iterator API or JDBC driver) returns the last 30 seconds of events.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>*</literal> wildcard and expressions can also be combined in a <literal>select</literal> clause. The combination selects all event properties and in addition the computed values
				as specified by any additional expressions that are part of the <literal>select</literal> clause. Here is an example that selects all properties of stock tick events plus a computed product of price and volume that the 
				statement names 'pricevolume':
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select *, price * volume as pricevolume from StockTick]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				When using wildcard (*), Esper does not actually read or copy your event properties out of your event or events, neither does it copy the event object. 
				It simply wraps your native type in an <literal>EventBean</literal> interface. Your application has access to
				the underlying event object through the <literal>getUnderlying</literal> method and has access to the property values through the <literal>get</literal> method.
			</para>

			<para>
				In a join statement, using the <literal>select *</literal> syntax selects one event property per stream to hold the event for that stream. The property name is the stream name in the <literal>from</literal> clause.

				If your statement is joining multiple streams, your may specify property names that are unique among the joined streams, or use wildcard (*) as explained earlier.
			</para>

			<para>
				In case the property name in your <literal>select</literal> or other clauses is not unique considering all joined streams, you will need to use the name of the stream as a prefix to the property.
			</para>

			<para>
				This example is a join between the two streams StockTick and News, respectively named as 'tick' and 'news'. The example selects from the StockTick event the symbol value using the 'tick' stream name as a prefix:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.symbol from StockTick#time(10) as tick, News#time(10) as news
where news.symbol = tick.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Use the wildcard (*) selector in a join to generate a property for each stream, with the property value being the event itself. The output events of the statement below have two properties: the 'tick' property holds the StockTick event and the 'news' property holds the News event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTick#time(10) as tick, News#time(10) as news]]></programlisting>

			</para>
			<synopsis>select <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>.* [as <emphasis>name</emphasis>] from ...</synopsis>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.* from StockTick#time(10) as tick, News#time(10) as news
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example uses the <literal>as</literal> keyword to name each stream's joined events. This instructs the engine to create a property for each named event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.* as stocktick, news.* as news 
from StockTick#time(10) as tick, News#time(10) as news
where stock.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The output events of the above example have two properties 'stocktick' and 'news' that are the StockTick and News events.
			</para>

			<para>
				The stream name itself, as further described in <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-stream-name"/>, may be used within expressions or alone. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This example passes events to a user-defined function named <literal>compute</literal> and also shows <literal>insert-into</literal> to populate an event stream of combined events:

				In summary, the <emphasis>stream_name.*</emphasis> streamname wildcard syntax can be used to select a stream as the underlying event or as a property, but cannot appear within an expression. While the <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis> syntax (without wildcard) always selects a property (and not as an underlying event), and can occur anywhere within an expression.

           <title>Choosing Event Properties and Events From a Pattern</title>

				If your statement employs pattern expressions, then your pattern expression tags events with a tag name. Each tag name becomes available for use as a property in the <literal>select</literal> clause and all other clauses.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For example, here is a very simple pattern that matches on every StockTick event received within 30 seconds after start of the statement. The sample selects the symbol and price properties of the matching events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.symbol as symbol, tick.price as price
from pattern[every tick=StockTick where timer:within(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The use of the wildcard selector, as shown in the next statement, creates a property for each tagged event in the output. The next statement outputs events that hold a single 'tick' property whose value is the event itself:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from pattern[every tick=StockTick where timer:within(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				You may also select the matching event itself using the <literal>tick.*</literal> syntax. The engine outputs the StockTick event itself to listeners:

				Event pattern expressions can also be used to specify one or more event streams in an EPL statement.
				For pattern-based event streams, the event stream definition <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> consists of the keyword <literal>pattern</literal> and a pattern expression in brackets <literal>[]</literal>. The syntax for an event stream definition using a pattern expression is below. As in filter-based event streams you can specify data windows.
			</para>
			
			<synopsis>pattern [<emphasis>pattern_expression</emphasis>] [#<emphasis>window_spec</emphasis>] [#<emphasis>window_spec</emphasis>] [...]</synopsis>

			<para>
				The next statement specifies an event stream that consists of both stock tick events and trade events. The example tags stock tick events with the name "tick" and trade events with the name "trade".
			</para>			
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select * from pattern [every tick=StockTickEvent or every trade=TradeEvent]]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				This statement generates an event every time the engine receives either one of the event types. The generated events resemble a map with "tick" and "trade" keys. For stock tick events, the "tick" key value is the underlying stock tick event, and the "trade" key value is a null value. For trade events, the "trade" key value is the underlying trade event, and the "tick" key value is a null value.
			</para>			

			<para>
				Lets further refine this statement adding a data window the gives us the last 30 seconds of either stock tick or trade events. Lets also select prices and a price total.
			</para>			
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.price as tickPrice, trade.price as tradePrice, 
       sum(tick.price) + sum(trade.price) as total
  from pattern [every tick=StockTickEvent or every trade=TradeEvent]#time(30 sec)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Note that in the statement above <literal>tickPrice</literal> and <literal>tradePrice</literal> can each be null values depending on the event processed. Therefore, an aggregation function such as <literal>sum(tick.price + trade.price))</literal> would always return null values as either of the two price properties are always a null value for any event matching the pattern. Use the <literal>coalesce</literal> function to handle null values, for example: <literal>sum(coalesce(tick.price, 0) + coalesce(trade.price, 0))</literal>.
			</para>			
			
			<note>
				<para>
					When used with patterns, specifying a data window defines what pattern matches to retain in memory for the purpose of joins or for using the iterator API.
				</para>
				<para>
					When used with patterns, specifying a data window does not limit pattern matches to events in the window. The <literal>match_recognize</literal> pattern matching however does limit matches to events retained by a data window.

           <title>Specifying Data Windows</title>
			<para>
				Data windows retain a subset of events. They provide an retain/expiry policy for events and the engine automatically removes events according to the retain/expiry policy. Data windows can be grouped and data windows can be intersected or unioned. See the section <xref linkend="epl-views"/> on the data windows available. Data windows can take parameters. Any expressions can be a parameter, with limitations.
			</para>

				The example statement below outputs a count per expressway for car location events (contains information about the location of a car on a highway) of the last 60 seconds:
			</para>
				
         <programlisting><![CDATA[select expressway, count(*) from CarLocEvent#time(60) 
group by expressway]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example declares <literal>#groupwin</literal> and a <literal>#length</literal> window to indicate that there is a separate length window per car id:
			</para>
				
         <programlisting><![CDATA[select cardId, expressway, direction, segment, count(*) 
from CarLocEvent#groupwin(carId)#length(4) 
group by carId, expressway, direction, segment]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The <literal>#groupwin(carId)</literal> groups car location events by car id. The <literal>#length(4)</literal> keeps a length window of the 4 last events, with one separate length window for each car id. 
				The example reports the number of events per car id and per expressway, direction and segment considering the last 4 events for each car id only. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The special keep-all window keeps all events: It does not expire events and does not provide a remove stream, i.e. events are not removed from the keep-all window unless by means of <literal>on-delete</literal> or <literal>on-merge</literal> or fire-and-forget <literal>delete</literal>.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 xml:id="epl-from-clause-view-multidatawindow" >
		   <title>Multiple Data Windows</title>
		   <para>
			   Data windows provide an expiry policy that indicates when to remove events from the data window, with the exception of the keep-all data window which has no expiry policy and the <literal>#groupwin</literal> grouped-window for allocating a new data window per group.
		   </para>
		   
		   <para>
			   EPL allows the freedom to use multiple data windows onto a stream and thus combine expiry policies. Combining data windows into an intersection (the default) or a union can achieve a useful strategy for retaining events and expiring events that are no longer of interest. Named windows, tables and <literal>on-merge</literal> and <literal>on-delete</literal> provide an additional degree of freedom.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   In order to combine two or more data windows there is no keyword required. The <emphasis>retain-intersection</emphasis> keyword is the default and the <emphasis>retain-union</emphasis> keyword may instead be provided for a stream.
		   </para>

			<para>
				The concept of union and intersection come from Set mathematics. In the language of Set mathematics, two sets A and B can be "added" together: The intersection of A and B is the set of all things which are members of both A and B, i.e. the members two sets have "in common". The union of A and B is the set of all things which are members of either A or B. 
			</para>

		   <para>
			   Use the <emphasis>retain-intersection</emphasis> (the default) keyword to retain an intersection of all events as defined by two or more data windows. All events removed from any of the intersected data windows are entered into the remove stream. This is the default behavior if neither retain keyword is specified.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   Use the <emphasis>retain-union</emphasis> keyword to retain a union of all events as defined by two or more data windows. Only events removed from all data windows are entered into the remove stream.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   The next example statement totals the price of OrderEvent events in a union of the last 30 seconds and unique by product name:
		   </para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select sum(price) from OrderEvent#time(30 sec)#unique(productName) retain-union]]></programlisting>		   
		   <para>
			   In the above statement, all OrderEvent events that are either less then 30 seconds old or that are the last event for the product name are considered.
		   </para>		   

		   <para>
			   Here is an example statement totals the price of OrderEvent events in an intersection of the last 30 seconds and unique by product name:
		   </para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select sum(price) from OrderEvent#time(30 sec)#unique(productName) retain-intersection]]></programlisting>		   
		   <para>
			   In the above statement, only those OrderEvent events that are both less then 30 seconds old and are the last event for the product name are considered. The number of events that the engine retains is the number of unique events per product name in the last 30 seconds (and not the number of events in the last 30 seconds).
		   </para>		   
		   
		   <para>
		     For an intersection the engine retains the minimal number of events representing that intersection. Thus when combining a time window of 30 seconds and a last-event window, for example, the number of events retained at any time is zero or one event (and not 30 seconds of events).
		   </para>

		   <para>
		     When combining a batch window into an intersection with another data window the combined data window gains batching semantics: Only when the batch criteria is fulfilled does the engine provide the batch of intersecting insert stream events. Multiple batch data windows may not be combined into an intersection.

           <title>Using the Stream Name</title>
			<para>
				Your <literal>from</literal> clause may assign a name to each stream. This assigned stream name can serve any of the following purposes.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				First, the stream name can be used to disambiguate property names. The <literal>stream_name.property_name</literal> syntax uniquely identifies which property to select if property names overlap between streams. Here is an example:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.productId, ord.productId from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Second, the stream name can be used with a wildcard (*) character to select events in a join, or assign new names to the streams in a join:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[// Select ProductEvent only
select prod.* from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[// Assign column names 'product' and 'order' to each event
select prod.* as product, ord.* as order from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Further, the stream name by itself can occur in any expression: The engine passes the event itself to that expression. For example, the engine passes the ProductEvent and the OrderEvent to the user-defined function 'checkOrder':
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.productId, MyFunc.checkOrder(prod, ord) 
from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Last, you may invoke an instance method on each event of a stream, and pass parameters to the instance method as well. Instance method calls are allowed anywhere in an expression.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The next statement demonstrates this capability by invoking a method 'computeTotal' on OrderEvent events and a method 'getMultiplier' on ProductEvent events:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select ord.computeTotal(prod.getMultiplier()) from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Instance methods may also be chained: Your EPL may invoke a method on the result returned by a method invocation.
			</para>

			<para>
				Assume that your product event exposes a method <literal>getZone</literal> which returns a zone object. Assume that the Zone class declares a method <literal>checkZone</literal>.
				This example statement invokes a method chain:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.getZone().checkZone("zone 1") from ProductEvent as prod]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Use the backwards apostrophe ` (aka. back tick) character to escape stream names in the <literal>from</literal>-clause and in <literal>on-</literal>trigger statements (e.g. <literal>from MyEvent as `order`...</literal>).

				<para>
					The aggregate functions are further documented in <xref linkend="epl-function-aggregation"/>. 
					You can use aggregate functions to calculate and summarize data from event properties.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, to find out the total price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds, type:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec)</programlisting>

				<para>
					Aggregation functions do not require the use of data windows. The examples herein specify data windows for the purpose of example.
					An alternative means to instruct the engine when to start and stop aggregating and on what level to aggregate is via context declarations.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, to find out the total price for all stock tick events since statement start, type:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent</programlisting>

				<synopsis><emphasis>aggregate_function</emphasis>( [all | distinct] <emphasis>expression</emphasis> [,<emphasis>expression</emphasis> [,...]] 
    [, group_by:<emphasis>local_group_by</emphasis>] [, filter:<emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis>] )</synopsis>

				<para>
					You can apply aggregate functions to all events in an event stream window or to one or more groups of events (i.e. <literal>group by</literal>). From each set of events to which an aggregate function is applied, Esper generates a single value. 
				</para>

				<para>
					<literal>Expression</literal> is usually an event property name. However it can also be a constant, function, or any combination of event property names, constants, 
					and functions connected by arithmetic operators.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					You can provide a grouping dimension for each aggregation function by providing the optional <literal>group_by</literal> parameter as part of aggregation function parameters. 
					Please refer to <xref linkend="epl-grouping-agglocal"/>.
				</para>			

				<para>
					You can provide a filter expression for each aggregation function by providing the optional <literal>filter</literal> parameter as part of aggregation function parameters. 
					Please refer to <xref linkend="epl-grouping-aggfilter"/>.
				</para>			

				<para>
					For example, to find out the average price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds if the price was doubled:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select avg(price * 2) from StockTickEvent#time(30 seconds)</programlisting>

				<para>
					You can use the optional keyword <literal>distinct</literal> with all aggregate functions to eliminate duplicate values before the aggregate function is applied. The optional 
					keyword <literal>all</literal> which performs the operation on all events is the default. 
				</para>
			
				<para>
					You can use aggregation functions in a <literal>select</literal> clause and in a <literal>having</literal> clause. You cannot use aggregate functions in a <literal>where</literal> clause, but you can use the <literal>where</literal> clause to restrict the events to which the aggregate is applied. The next query computes the average and sum of the price of stock tick events for the symbol IBM only, for the last 10 stock tick events regardless of their symbol.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice
from StockTickEvent#length(10)
where symbol='IBM'</programlisting>				
								
				<para>
					In the above example the length window of 10 elements is not affected by the <literal>where</literal> clause, i.e. all events enter and leave the length window regardless of their symbol. If you only care about the last 10 IBM events, you need to add filter criteria as below.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice
from StockTickEvent(symbol='IBM')#length(10)

				<para>
					Esper ignores any null values returned by the event property or expression on which the aggregate function is operating, except for the <literal>count(*)</literal> function, which counts null values as well.

				<para>
					The <literal>group by</literal> clause is optional in all EPL statements. The <literal>group by</literal> clause divides the output of an EPL statement into groups. You can group by one or more event property names, or by the result of computed expressions. When used with aggregate functions, <literal>group by</literal> retrieves the calculations in each subgroup. You can use <literal>group by</literal> without aggregate functions, but generally that can produce confusing results.
				</para>
	
				<para>
					For example, the below statement returns the total price per symbol for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) group by symbol</programlisting>

				<orderedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Expressions in the <literal>group by</literal> cannot contain aggregate functions.

					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							When grouping an unbound stream, i.e. no data window is specified onto the stream providing groups, or when using output rate limiting with the ALL keyword, you should ensure your group-by expression does not return an unlimited number of values. If, for example, your group-by expression is a fine-grained timestamp, group state that accumulates for an unlimited number of groups potentially reduces available memory significantly.
							Use a @Hint as described below to instruct the engine when to discard group state.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
				
				<para>
					You can list more then one expression in the <literal>group by</literal> clause to nest groups. Once the sets are established with <literal>group by</literal> the aggregation
					functions are applied. This statement posts the median volume for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds per symbol and tick data feed. Esper posts one event for each group to statement listeners:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, median(volume) 
from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					In the statement above the event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list (symbol, tickDataFeed) are also listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement thus follows the SQL standard which prescribes that non-aggregated event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list must match the 
					<literal>group by</literal> columns.
				</para>

				<para>
					Esper also supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list are not listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement below demonstrates this case. It calculates the standard deviation since statement start over stock ticks aggregating by symbol and posting for 
					each event the symbol, tickDataFeed and the standard deviation on price.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, stddev(price) from StockTickEvent group by symbol</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					The above example still aggregates the <literal>price</literal> event property based on the <literal>symbol</literal>, but produces one event per incoming event, not one 
					event per group.
				</para>

				<para>
					Additionally, Esper supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>group by</literal> clause are not listed in the <literal>select</literal> list.
					This is an example that calculates the mean deviation per <literal>symbol</literal> and <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> and posts one event per group with <literal>symbol</literal> and mean deviation of price in the generated events. Since tickDataFeed is not in the posted results, this can potentially be confusing.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, avedev(price) 
from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>

				<para>
					Expressions are also allowed in the <literal>group by</literal> list:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol * price, count(*) from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) group by symbol * price</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					If the <literal>group by</literal> expression resulted in a null value, the null value becomes its own group. All null values are aggregated into the same group. If you are using the <literal>count(expression)</literal> aggregate function which does not count null values, the count returns zero if only null values are encountered.								
				</para>

				<para>
					You can use a <literal>where</literal> clause in a statement with <literal>group by</literal>. Events that do not satisfy the conditions in the <literal>where</literal> clause are eliminated before any grouping is done. For example, the statement below posts the number of stock ticks in the last 30 seconds with a volume larger then 100, posting one event per group (symbol).
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, count(*) from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) where volume &gt; 100 group by symbol</programlisting>

						The Esper engine reclaims aggregation state agressively when it determines that a group has no data points, based on the data in the data windows. When your application data creates a large number of groups with a small or zero number of data points then performance may suffer as state is reclaimed and created anew. Esper provides the <literal>@Hint('disable_reclaim_group')</literal> hint that you can specify as part of an EPL statement text to avoid group reclaim.

			 <title>Using Group-By with Rollup, Cube and Grouping Sets</title>
			 
			 <para>
				 EPL supports the SQL-standard <literal>rollup</literal>, <literal>cube</literal> and <literal>grouping sets</literal> keywords. These keywords are available only in the <literal>group-by</literal> clause and instruct the engine to compute higher-level (or super-aggregate) aggregation values, i.e. to perform multiple levels of analysis (groupings) at the same time.
			 </para>
			 
			 <para>
				 EPL also supports the SQL-standard <literal>grouping</literal> and <literal>grouping_id</literal> functions. These functions can be used in the <literal>select</literal>-clause, <literal>having</literal>-clause or <literal>order by</literal>-clause to obtain information about the current row's grouping level in expressions. Please see <xref linkend="epl-single-row-function-grouping"/>.
			 </para>

			<para>
				Detailed examples and information in respect to output rate limiting can be found in <xref linkend="outputspec-groupedrowpergrouprollup"/>.
			</para>
 
			 <para>
			     Use the <literal>rollup</literal> keyword in the <literal>group-by</literal> lists of expressions to compute the equivalent of an OLAP dimension or hierarchy. 
			 </para>
			 
			 <para>
				 For example, the following statement outputs for each incoming event three rows. The first row contains the total volume per symbol and feed, the second row contains the total volume per symbol and the third row contains the total volume overall. This example aggregates across all events for each aggregation level (3 groupings) since it declares no data window:
			 </para>
			<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, sum(volume) from StockTickEvent
group by rollup(symbol, tickDataFeed)</programlisting>

			<para>
				The value of <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> is <literal>null</literal> for the output row that contains the total per symbol and the output row that contains the total volume overall. 
				The value of both <literal>symbol</literal> and <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> is <literal>null</literal> for the output row that contains the overall total.
			</para>

			 <para>
			     Use the <literal>cube</literal> keyword in the <literal>group-by</literal> lists of expressions to compute a cross-tabulation. 
			 </para>
			 
			 <para>
				 The following statement outputs for each incoming event four rows. The first row contains the total volume per symbol and feed, the second row contains the total volume per symbol, the third row contains the total volume per feed and the forth row contains the total volume overall (4 groupings):
			 </para>
			<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, sum(volume) from StockTickEvent
group by cube(symbol, tickDataFeed)</programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The <literal>grouping sets</literal> keywords allows you to specify only the groupings you want. It can thus be used to generate the same groupings that simple <literal>group-by</literal> expressions, <literal>rollup</literal> or <literal>cube</literal> would produce.
			</para>

			 <para>
				 In this example each incoming event causes the engine to compute two output rows: The first row contains the total volume per symbol and the second row contains the total volume per feed (2 groupings):

group by symbol, rollup(tickDataFeed)</programlisting>

			<para>

group by grouping sets (symbol, tickDataFeed, ())</programlisting>

			<para>
				The order of any output events for both insert and remove stream data is well-defined and exactly as indicated before. For example, specifying <literal>grouping sets ((), symbol, tickDataFeed)</literal> outputs a total overall, a total by symbol and a total by feed in that order. If the statement has an <literal>order-by</literal>-clause then the ordering criteria of the <literal>order-by</literal>-clause take precedence.

			</para>
			 
			<para>
				For un-grouped queries (without a <literal>group by </literal> clause), if any aggregation function specifies a <literal>group_by</literal> other than the <literal>()</literal> overall group, the query executes

				<para>
					Use the <literal>having</literal> clause to pass or reject events defined by the <literal>group-by</literal> clause. The <literal>having</literal> clause sets conditions for the <literal>group by</literal> clause in the same way <literal>where</literal> sets conditions for the <literal>select</literal> clause, except <literal>where</literal> cannot include aggregate functions, while <literal>having</literal> often does.
				</para>
			
				<para>
					This statement is an example of a <literal>having</literal> clause with an aggregate function. It posts the total price per symbol for the last 30 seconds of stock tick events for only those symbols in which the total price exceeds 1000. The <literal>having</literal> clause eliminates all symbols where the total price is equal or less then 1000.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) 
from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) 
group by symbol 
having sum(price) &gt; 1000</programlisting>

				<para>
					To include more then one condition in the <literal>having</literal> clause combine the conditions with <literal>and</literal>, <literal>or</literal> or <literal>not</literal>.
					This is shown in the statement below which selects only groups with a total price greater then 1000 and an average volume less then 500.
				</para>

from StockTickEvent#time(30 sec) 
group by symbol 
having sum(price) &gt; 1000 and avg(volume) &lt; 500</programlisting>			

				<para>
					A statement with the <literal>having</literal> clause should also have a <literal>group by</literal> clause. If you omit <literal>group-by</literal>, all the events not excluded
					by the <literal>where</literal> clause return as a single group. In that case <literal>having</literal> acts like a <literal>where</literal> except that <literal>having</literal> can have aggregate functions.

				<para>
					Esper filters events using the filter criteria for the event stream <literal>StockTickEvent</literal>. In the example above only events with symbol IBM enter the length window over the last 10 events, all other events are simply discarded. The <literal>where</literal> clause removes any events posted by the length window (events entering the window and event leaving the window) that do not match the condition of volume greater then 1000. Remaining events are applied to the <literal>stddev</literal> standard deviation aggregate function for each tick data feed as specified in the <literal>group by</literal> clause. Each <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> value generates one event. Esper applies the <literal>having</literal> clause and only lets events pass for <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> groups with a standard deviation of price greater then 0.8.

This section explains the key differences in their behavior and use.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The keyed segmented context as declared with <emphasis>create context ... partition by</emphasis> and <emphasis>context .... select ...</emphasis> creates a new context partition per key value(s). The engine maintains separate data windows as well as separate aggregations per context partition; thereby the keyed segmented context applies to both. See <xref linkend="context_def_keyed"/> for additional examples.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause works together with aggregation functions in your statement to produce an aggregation result per group. In greater detail, this means that when a new event arrives, the engine applies the expressions in the <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause to determine a grouping key. If the engine has not encountered that grouping key before (a new group), the engine creates a set of new aggregation results for that grouping key and performs the aggregation changing that new set of aggregation results. If the grouping key points to an existing set of prior aggregation results (an existing group), the engine performs the aggregation changing the prior set of aggregation results for that group.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>#groupwin</emphasis> instructs the system to have a separate data window per group, see <xref linkend="view-std-groupwin"/>. It causes allocation of separate data window(s) for each grouping key encountered.

				The next example shows queries that produce equivalent results. The query using the <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause is generally preferable as is easier to read. The second form introduces the <literal>#uni</literal> special data window which computes univariate statistics for a given property:
			</para>

			<programlisting>select symbol, avg(price) from StockTickEvent group by symbol
// ... is equivalent to ...
select symbol, average from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#uni(price)</programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example shows two queries that are NOT equivalent as the length window is ungrouped in the first query, and grouped in the second query:
			</para>

			<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#length(10) group by symbol
// ... NOT equivalent to ...
select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#groupwin(symbol)#length(10)</programlisting>

			<para>
				The key difference between the two statements is that in the first statement the length window is ungrouped and applies to all events regardless of group. While in the second query each group gets its own length window. For example, in the second query events arriving for symbol "ABC" get a length window of 10 events, and events arriving for symbol "DEF" get their own length window of 10 events.

				<para>
					Last, output can be controlled by an expression that may contain variables, user-defined functions and information about the number of collected events. Output that is controlled by an expression is discussed in detail below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>after</literal> keyword and <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis> can appear alone or together with further output conditions and suppresses output events.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, the following statement outputs, every 60 seconds, the total price for all orders in the 30-minute time window:		
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent#time(30 min) output snapshot every 60 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
					The <literal>all</literal> keyword is the default and specifies that all events in a batch should be output, each incoming row in the batch producing an output row.
					Note that for statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause, the <literal>all</literal> keyword provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>first</literal> keyword specifies that only the first event in an output batch is to be output.
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output the first matching event as soon as it arrives, and then ignores matching events for the time interval or number of events specified. 
					After the time interval elapsed, or the number of matching events has been reached, the next first matching event is output again and the following interval the engine again ignores matching events.
					For statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause, the <literal>first</literal> keywords provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>last</literal> keyword specifies to only output the last event at the end of the given time interval or after the given number of matching events
					have been accumulated. Again, for statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause the <literal>last</literal> keyword provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>snapshot</literal> keyword is often used with unbound streams and/or aggregation to output current aggregation results. While the other keywords control how a batch of events between output intervals is being considered, the <literal>snapshot</literal> keyword outputs current state of a statement independent of the last batch. Its output is comparable to the <literal>iterator</literal> method provided by a statement. More information on <literal>output snapshot</literal> can be found in <xref linkend="epl-output-snapshot"/>.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <emphasis>output_rate</emphasis> is the frequency at which the engine outputs events. It can be specified in terms of time or number of events. The value can be a number to denote a fixed output rate, or the name of a variable whose value is the output rate. By means of a variable the output rate can be controlled externally and changed dynamically at runtime. 
				</para>

				<para>
					Please consult the <xref linkend="appendix_outputspec"/> for detailed information on insert and remove stream output for the various <literal>output</literal> clause keywords.
				</para>
				
				<para>
				  For use with contexts you may append the keywords <literal>and when terminated</literal> to trigger output at the rate defined and in addition trigger output when the context partition terminates. Please see <xref linkend="context_outputterminated"/> for details.
				</para>
				
				<note>
					<para>
						Please see <xref linkend="appendix_outputlimit"/> for information on how the system retains input events and computes output events according to the specified output rate.
					</para>
				</note>
				
				<para>
					The time interval can also be specified in terms of minutes; the following statement is identical to the first one.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent output every 1.5 minutes</programlisting>

				<para>
					A second way that output can be stabilized is by batching events until a certain number of events have been collected:
				</para>				
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent output every 5 events</programlisting>
			    
				<para>
					Additionally, event output can be further modified by the optional <literal>last</literal> keyword, which causes output of only the last event to arrive into an output batch.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent output last every 5 events</programlisting>

				<para>
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword you can be notified at the start of the interval. The allows to watch for situations such as a rate falling below a threshold
					and only be informed every now and again after the specified output interval, but be informed the moment it first happens. 
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from TickRate where rate&lt;100 output first every 60 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
					A sample statement using the Unix "crontab"-command schedule is shown next. See <xref linkend="pattern-timer-at"/> for details on schedule syntax. Here, output occurs every 15 minutes from 8am to 5:45pm (hours 8 to 17 at 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour):

						Output can also be controlled by an expression that may check variable values, use user-defined functions and query built-in properties that provide additional information. The synopsis is as follows:
					</para>
					<synopsis>output [after <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis>] 
  [[all | first | last | snapshot] when <emphasis>trigger_expression</emphasis>

    [then set variable_name = assign_expression [, variable_name = assign_expression [,...]]]
  ]</synopsis>

					<para>
						The <literal>when</literal> keyword must be followed by a trigger expression returning a boolean value of true or false, indicating whether to output.
						Use the optional <literal>then</literal> keyword to change variable values after the trigger expression evaluates to true. An assignment expression assigns a new value to variable(s).
					</para>
					
					<para>
					  For use with contexts you may append the keywords <literal>and when terminated</literal> to also trigger output when the context partition terminates. Please see <xref linkend="context_outputterminated"/> for details. You may optionally specify a termination expression. If that expression is provided the 
					  engine evaluates the expression when the context partition terminates: The evaluation result of <literal>true</literal> means output occurs when the context partition terminates, <literal>false</literal> means no output occurs when the context partition terminates.
					  You may specify <literal>then set</literal> followed by a list of assignments to assign variables. Assignments are executed on context partition termination regardless of the termination expression, if present.
					</para>

					<para>
						Lets consider an example. The next statement assumes that your application has defined a variable by name OutputTriggerVar of boolean type. The statement outputs rows only when the OutputTriggerVar variable has a boolean value of true:
					</para>
					<synopsis>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent output when OutputTriggerVar = true</synopsis>

					<para>
						The engine evaluates the trigger expression when streams and data windows (if any) post one or more insert or remove stream events after considering the <literal>where</literal> clause, if present. It also evaluates the trigger expression when any of the variables used in the trigger expression, if any, changes value. Thus output occurs as follows:
					</para>

					<orderedlist spacing="compact">
						<listitem>
							<para>
								When there are insert or remove stream events and the <literal>when</literal> trigger expression evaluates to true, the engine outputs the resulting rows.

								When any of the variables in the <literal>when</literal> trigger expression changes value, the engine evaluates the expression and outputs results. Result output occurs within the minimum time interval of timer resolution.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>

					<para>
						By adding a <literal>then</literal> part to the EPL, you can reset any variables after the trigger expression evaluated to true:
					</para>

  output when OutputTriggerVar = true  
  then set OutputTriggerVar = false</programlisting>

					<indexterm><primary>after</primary></indexterm>
					<para>
						The <literal>after</literal> keyword and its time period or number of events parameters is optional and can occur after the <literal>output</literal> keyword, either alone or with output conditions as listed above.
					</para>

					<para>
						The synopsis of <literal>after</literal> is as follows:
					</para>
					<synopsis>output after <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> | <emphasis>number</emphasis> events [...]</synopsis>

					<para>
						When using <literal>after</literal> either alone or together with further output conditions, the engine discards all output events until the time period passed as measured from the start of the statement, or until the
						number of output events are reached. The discarded events are not output and do not count towards any further output conditions if any are specified.
					</para>

					<para>
						For example, the following statement outputs every minute the total price for all orders in the 30-minute time window but only after 30 minutes have passed:		
					</para>
					<programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent#time(30 min) output after 30 min snapshot every 1 min</programlisting>

					<para>
						An example in which <literal>after</literal> occur alone is below, in a statement that outputs total price for all orders in the last minute but only after 1 minute passed, each time an event arrives or leaves the data window:
					</para>
					<programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent#time(1 min) output after 1 min</programlisting>

					<para>
						To demonstrate <literal>after</literal> when used with an event count, this statement find pairs of orders with the same id but suppresses output for the first 5 pairs:

        <sect2 xml:id="epl-output-groupby" >
				<title>Aggregation, Group By, Having and Output Clause Interaction</title>
			
				<para>
					Remove stream events can also be useful in conjunction with aggregation and the <literal>output</literal> clause: When the engine posts remove stream events for fully-aggregated queries, it presents the aggregation state before the expiring event leaves the data window. Your application can thus easily obtain a delta between the new aggregation value and the prior aggregation value.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The engine evaluates the having-clause at the granularity of the data posted by data windows (if any) or when an event arrives (without a data windows). That is, if you utilize a time window and output every 10 events, the <literal>having</literal> clause applies to each individual event or events entering and leaving the time window (and not once per batch of 10 events).
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>output</literal> clause interacts in two ways with the <literal>group by</literal> and <literal>having</literal> clauses. First, in the <literal>output every n events </literal>case, the number <literal>n</literal> refers to the number of events arriving into the <literal>group by clause</literal>. That is, if the <literal>group by</literal> clause outputs only 1 event per group, or if the arriving events don't satisfy the <literal>having</literal> clause, then the actual number of events output by the statement could be fewer than <literal>n</literal>.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					Second, the <literal>last</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and <literal>first</literal> keywords have special meanings when used in a statement with aggregate functions and the <literal>group by</literal> clause:
				</para>
				<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>

				</para>
				
				<para>
				  The next statement outputs total price per symbol cumulatively (no data window was used here). As it specifies the <literal>all</literal> keyword, the statement outputs the current value for all groups seen so far, regardless of whether the group was updated in the last interval. Output occurs after an interval of 5 seconds passed and at the end of each subsequent interval:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent group by symbol output all every 5 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
				  The below statement outputs total price per symbol considering events in the last 3 minutes. When events leave the 3-minute data window output also occurs as new aggregation values are computed. The <literal>last</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output only those groups that had changes. Output occurs after an interval of 10 seconds passed and at the end of each subsequent interval:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent#time(3 min)
group by symbol output last every 10 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
				  This statement also outputs total price per symbol considering events in the last 3 minutes. The <literal>first</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output as soon as there is a new value for a group. After output for a given group the engine suppresses output for the same group for 10 seconds and does not suppress output for other groups. Output occurs again for that group after the interval when the group has new value(s):

		<para>
			The <literal>limit</literal> clause is typically used together with the <literal>order by</literal> and <literal>output</literal> clause to limit your query results to those that fall within a specified range. You can use it to receive the first given number of result rows, or to receive a range of result rows. 
		</para>

		<para>

		</para>
		<synopsis>limit <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> [offset <emphasis>offset_count</emphasis>]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The required <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> parameter specifies the number of rows to output. The <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> can be an integer constant 
			and can also be the name of the integer-type variable to evaluate at runtime.
		</para>

		<para>
			The optional <emphasis>offset_count</emphasis> parameter specifies the number of rows that should be skipped (offset) at the beginning of the result set. A variable can also be used for this parameter.
		</para>

		<para>

		<programlisting>select uri, count(*) from WebEvent

		<para>
			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause is optional in Esper. The clause can be specified to make the results of a statement available as an event stream for use

		<para>
			The <literal>istream</literal> (default) and <literal>rstream</literal> keywords are optional. If no keyword or the <literal>istream</literal> keyword is specified, the engine supplies the insert stream events generated by the statement. The insert stream consists of the events entering the respective window(s) or stream(s). If the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword is specified, the engine supplies the remove stream events generated by the statement. The remove stream consists of the events leaving the respective window(s). 
		</para>

		<para>
			If your application specifies <literal>irstream</literal>, the engine inserts into the new stream both the insert and remove stream. This is often useful in connection with the <literal>istream</literal> built-in function that returns an inserted/removed boolean indicator for each event, see <xref linkend="epl-single-row-function-istream"/>.

			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause can consist of just an event stream name, or an event stream name and one or more property names.
		</para>

		<para>

				A <emphasis>variant stream</emphasis> is a predefined stream into which events of multiple disparate event types can be inserted. 
			</para>

			<para>
				A variant stream name may appear anywhere in a pattern or <literal>from</literal> clause. In a pattern, a filter against a variant stream matches any events of any of the event types inserted into the variant stream. 
				In a <literal>from</literal> clause including for named windows, data windows may hold events of any of the event types inserted into the variant stream.
			</para>

			<para>
				A variant stream is thus useful in problems that require different types of event to be treated the same.
			</para>

			<para>
				Variant streams can be declared by means of <literal>create variant schema</literal> or can be predefined via runtime or initialization-time configuration as described in <xref linkend="config-variantstream"/>. Your application may declare or predefine variant streams to carry events of a limited set of event types, or you may choose the variant stream to carry any and all types of events. This choice affects what event properties are available for consuming statements or patterns of the variant stream.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				Assume that an application predefined a variant stream named <literal>OrderStream</literal> to carry only <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> and <literal>ProductOrder</literal> events. An <literal>insert into</literal> clause inserts events into
				the variant stream:
			</para>
			<programlisting>insert into OrderStream select * from ServiceOrder</programlisting>

			</para>
			<programlisting>select customerId, sum(price) from OrderStream#time(30 sec) group by customerId</programlisting>			

			<para>
				If your application predefines the variant stream to hold specific type of events, as the sample above did, then all event properties that are common to all specified types are visible on the variant stream, including nested, indexed and mapped properties. For access to properties that are only available on one of the types, the dynamic property syntax must be used. In the example above, the <literal>customerId</literal> and <literal>price</literal> were properties common to both <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> and <literal>ProductOrder</literal> events.
			</para>		

			<para>
				For example, here is a consuming statement that selects a <literal>service duraction</literal> property that only <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> events have, and that must therefore be casted to double and null values removed in order to aggregate:

			<programlisting>select customerId, sum(coalesce(cast(serviceDuraction?, double), 0))

		<indexterm><primary>subqueries</primary></indexterm>
		<indexterm><primary>EPL</primary><secondary>subqueries</secondary></indexterm>

		<para>
			A subquery is a <literal>select</literal> within another statement. Esper supports subqueries in the <literal>select</literal> clause, <literal>where</literal> clause, <literal>having</literal> clause and in stream and pattern filter expressions. Subqueries provide an alternative way to perform operations that would otherwise require complex joins. Subqueries can also make statements more readable then complex joins.
	    </para>

		<para>
			Esper supports both simple subqueries as well as correlated subqueries. In a simple subquery, the inner query is not correlated to the outer query. Here is an example simple subquery within a <literal>select</literal> clause:
	    </para>
			
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select assetId, (select zone from ZoneClosed#lastevent) as lastClosed from RFIDEvent]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			If the inner query is dependent on the outer query, you will have a correlated subquery. An example of a correlated subquery is shown below. Notice the <literal>where</literal> clause in the inner query, where the condition involves a stream from the outer query:
	    </para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent as RFID where 'Dock 1' = 
  (select name from Zones#unique(zoneId) where zoneId = RFID.zoneId)]]></programlisting>
		
		<para>
			The example above shows a subquery in the <literal>where</literal> clause. The statement selects RFID events in which the zone name matches a string constant based on zone id. The statement sets <literal>#unique</literal> to guarantee that only the last event per zone id is retained for processing by the subquery.
		</para>

		<para>
			The next example is a correlated subquery within a <literal>select</literal> clause. In this statement the <literal>select</literal> clause retrieves the zone name by means of a subquery against the Zones set of events correlated by zone id:
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select zoneId, (select name from Zones#unique(zoneId) 
  where zoneId = RFID.zoneId) as name from RFIDEvent]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Note that when a simple or correlated subquery returns multiple rows, the engine returns a <literal>null</literal> value as the subquery result. To limit the number of events returned by a subquery consider using one of the <literal>#lastevent</literal>, <literal>#unique</literal> data windows or aggregation functions or the multi-row and multi-column-select as described below.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause of a subquery also allows wildcard selects, which return as an event property the underlying event object of the event type as defined in the <literal>from</literal> clause. An example:
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select (select * from MarketData#lastevent) as md 
  from pattern [every timer:interval(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The output events to the statement above contain the underlying MarketData event in a property named "md". The statement populates the last MarketData event into a property named "md" every 10 seconds following the pattern definition, or populates a <literal>null</literal> value if no MarketData event has been encountered so far.
		</para>

		<para>
			Aggregation functions may be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause of the subselect as this example outlines:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MarketData
where price > (select max(price) from MarketData(symbol='GOOG')#lastevent)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			As the sub-select expression is evaluated first (by default), the query above actually never fires for the GOOG symbol, only for other symbols that have a price higher then the current maximum for GOOG. As a sidenote, the <literal>insert into</literal> clause can also be handy to compute aggregation results for use in multiple subqueries.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			When using aggregation functions in a correlated subselect the engine computes the aggregation based on data window (if provided), named window or table contents matching the where-clause.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The following example compares the quantity value provided by the current order event against the total quantity of all order events in the last 1 hour for the same client.
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from OrderEvent oe
where qty > 
  (select sum(qty) from OrderEvent#time(1 hour) pd 
  where pd.client = oe.client)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Filter expressions in a pattern or stream may also employ subqueries. Subqueries can be uncorrelated or can be correlated to properties of the stream or to properties of tagged events in a pattern. Subqueries may reference named windows and tables as well.
		</para>

		<para>
			The following example filters <literal>BarData</literal> events that have a close price less then the last moving average (field <literal>movAgv</literal>) as provided by stream <literal>SMA20Stream</literal> (an uncorrelated subquery):
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from BarData(ticker='MSFT', closePrice < 
    (select movAgv from SMA20Stream(ticker='MSFT')#lastevent))]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			A few generic examples follow to demonstrate the point. The examples use short event and property names so they are easy to read.

			The order of evaluation of subqueries relative to the containing statement is guaranteed: If the containing statement and its subqueries are reacting to the same type of event, the subquery will receive the

		</para>

		<para>
			Performance of your statement containing one or more subqueries principally depends on two parameters. First, if your subquery correlates one or more columns in the subquery stream with the enclosing statement's streams, the engine automatically builds the appropriate indexes for fast row retrieval based on the key values correlated (joined). The second parameter is the number of rows found in the subquery stream and the complexity of the filter criteria (<literal>where</literal> clause), as each row in the subquery stream must evaluate against the <literal>where</literal> clause filter.

			<title>Hints Related to Subqueries</title>

			<para>
				The following hints are available to tune performance and memory use of subqueries.
			</para>

			<para>
				Use the <literal>@Hint('set_noindex')</literal> hint for a statement that utilizes one or more subqueries. It instructs the engine to always perform a full scan. The engine does not build an implicit index or use an explicitly-created index when this hint is provided. Use of the hint may result in reduced memory use but poor statement performance.
			</para>

			<para>
				The following hints are available to tune performance and memory use of subqueries that select from named windows (does not apply to tables).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Named windows are globally-visible data windows. As such an application may create explicit indexes as discussed in <xref linkend="named_explicit_index"/>. The engine may also elect to create implicit indexes (no create-index EPL required) for index-based lookup of rows when executing <literal>on-select</literal>, <literal>on-merge</literal>, <literal>on-update</literal> and <literal>on-delete</literal> statements and for statements that subquery a named window.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				By default and without specifying a hint, each statement that subqueries a named window also maintains its own index for looking up events held by the named window. The engine maintains the index by consuming the named window insert and remove stream. When the statement is destroyed it releases that index.
			</para>

			<para>
				Specify the <literal>@Hint('enable_window_subquery_indexshare')</literal> hint to enable subquery index sharing for named windows. When using this hint, indexes for subqueries are maintained by the named window itself (and not each statement context partition), are shared between one or more statements and may also utilize explicit indexes. Specify the hint once as part of the <literal>create window</literal> statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				This sample EPL statement creates a named window with subquery index sharing enabled:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[@Hint('enable_window_subquery_indexshare')
create window OrdersNamedWindow#keepall as OrderMapEventType]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				When subquery index sharing is enabled, performance may increase as named window stream consumption is no longer needed for correlated subqueries. You may also expect reduced memory use especially if a large number of EPL statements perform similar subqueries against a named window. Subquery index sharing may require additional short-lived object creation and may slightly increase lock held time for named windows. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The following statement performs a correlated subquery against the named window above. When a settlement event arrives it select the order detail for the same order id as provided by the settlement event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select 
  (select * from OrdersNamedWindow as onw 
    where onw.orderId = se.orderId) as orderDetail
  from SettlementEvent as se]]></programlisting>
  
			  <para>
				  With subquery index sharing enabled the engine maintains an index of order events by order id for the named window, and shares that index between additional statements until the time all utilizing statements are destroyed.
			  </para>
			
			<para>
				You may disable subquery index sharing for a specific statement by specifying the <literal>@Hint('disable_window_subquery_indexshare')</literal> hint, as this example shows, causing the statement to maintain its own index:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[@Hint('disable_window_subquery_indexshare')

  (select * from OrdersNamedWindow as onw 
    where onw.orderId = se.orderId) as orderDetail

			<title>Introducing Joins</title>

			<para>
				Two or more event streams can be part of the <literal>from</literal>-clause and thus both (all) streams determine the resulting events. This section summarizes the important concepts. The sections that follow present more detail on each topic.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The default join is an inner join which produces output events only when there is at least one match in all streams.
			</para>

			<para>
				Consider the sample statement shown next:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent#lastevent, NewsEvent#lastevent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The above statement outputs the last TickEvent and the last NewsEvent in one output event when either a TickEvent or a NewsEvent arrives. If no TickEvent was received before a NewsEvent arrives, no output occurs. Similarly when no NewsEvent was received before a TickEvent arrives, no output occurs.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>where</literal>-clause lists the join conditions that Esper uses to relate events in the two or more streams. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example statement retains the last TickEvent and last NewsEvent per symbol, and joins the two streams based on their symbol value:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent#unique(symbol) as t, NewsEvent#unique(symbol) as n
where t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				As before, when a TickEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching NewsEvent then there is no output event.
			</para>

			<para>
				An outer join does not require each event in either stream to have a matching event. The full outer join is useful when output is desired when no match is found. The different outer join types (full, left, right) are explained in more detail below.
			</para>

			<para>
				This example statement is an outer-join and also returns the last TickEvent and last NewsEvent per symbol: 
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent#unique(symbol) as t
full outer join NewsEvent#unique(symbol) as n on t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In the sample statement above, when a TickEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching NewsEvent, or when a NewsEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching TickEvent, the statement still produces an output event with a null column value for the missing event.
			</para>

			<para>
				Note that each of the sample queries above defines a data window. The sample queries above use the last-event data window (#lastevent) or the unique data window (#unique). A data window serves to indicate the subset of events to join from each stream and may be required depending on the join.
			</para>

			<para>
				In above queries, when either a TickEvent arrives or when a NewsEvent arrives then the query evaluates and there is output. The same holds true if additional streams are added to the <literal>from</literal>-clause: Each of the streams in the <literal>from</literal>-clause trigger the join to evaluate.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword instructs the engine to evaluate the join only when an event arrives from the single stream that was marked with the <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword. In this case no data window should be specified for the stream marked as <literal>unidirectional</literal> since the keyword implies that the current event of that stream triggers the join.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Here is the sample statement above with <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword, so that output occurs only when a TickEvent arrives and not when a NewsEvent arrives:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent as t unidirectional, NewsEvent#unique(symbol) as n 
where t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				It is oftentimes the case that an aggregation (count, sum, average) only needs to be calculated in the context of an arriving event or timer. Consider using the <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword when aggregating over joined streams.
			</para>

			<para>
				An EPL pattern is a normal citizen also providing a stream of data consisting of pattern matches. A time pattern, for example, can be useful to evaluate a join and produce output upon each interval.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This sample statement includes a pattern that fires every 5 seconds and thus triggers the join to evaluate and produce output, computing an aggregated total quantity per symbol every 5 seconds:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, sum(qty) from pattern[every timer:interval(5 sec)] unidirectional, 
  TickEvent#unique(symbol) t, NewsEvent#unique(symbol) as n 
where t.symbol = n.symbol group by symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Named windows as well as reference and historical data such as stored in your relational database, and data returned by a method/script/UDF invocation, can also be included in joins as discussed in <xref linkend="histdata_overview"/> and <xref linkend="joining_method"/>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Related to joins are subqueries: A subquery is a <literal>select</literal> within another statement, see <xref linkend="epl-subqueries"/>
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The engine performs extensive query analysis and planning, building internal indexes and strategies as required to allow fast evaluation of many types of queries.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 xml:id="epl-join-inner">
			<title>Inner (Default) Joins</title>			
	
			<para>
				Each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, the two event streams are joined and output events are produced according to the <literal>where</literal> clause when matching events are found for all joined streams.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				This example joins 2 event streams. The first event stream consists of fraud warning events for which it keep the last 30 minutes. The second stream is withdrawal events for which it considers the last 30 seconds. The streams are joined on account number.
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select fraud.accountNumber as accntNum, fraud.warning as warn, withdraw.amount as amount,
       max(fraud.timestamp, withdraw.timestamp) as timestamp, 'withdrawlFraud' as desc
  from com.espertech.esper.example.atm.FraudWarningEvent#time(30 min) as fraud,
       com.espertech.esper.example.atm.WithdrawalEvent#time(30 sec) as withdraw
 where fraud.accountNumber = withdraw.accountNumber]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Joins can also include one or more pattern statements as the next example shows:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from FraudWarningEvent#time(30 min) as fraud,
    pattern [every w=WithdrawalEvent -> PINChangeEvent(acct=w.acct)]#lastevent as withdraw
 where fraud.accountNumber = withdraw.w.accountNumber]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The statement above joins the last 30 minutes of fraud warnings with a pattern. The pattern consists of every withdrawal event that is followed by a PIN change event for the same account number. It joins the two event streams on account number. The last-event window instucts the join to only consider the last pattern match.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				In a join and outer join, your statement must declare a data window onto each stream. Streams that are marked as unidirectional and named windows and tables as well as database or methods in a join are an exception and do not require a data window. If you are joining an event to itself via contained-event selection, data windows also do not need to be specified. The reason that a data window must be declared is that a data window specifies which events are considered for the join (i.e. last event, last 10 events, all events, last 1 second of events etc.).
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The next example joins all FraudWarningEvent events that arrived since the statement was started, with the last 20 seconds of PINChangeEvent events:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from FraudWarningEvent#keepall as fraud, PINChangeEvent#time(20 sec) as pin
 where fraud.accountNumber = pin.accountNumber]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The above example employed the special keep-all window that retains all events.

			<para>
				Esper supports left outer joins, right outer joins, full outer joins and inner joins in any combination between an unlimited number of event streams. Outer and inner joins can also join reference and historical data as explained in <xref linkend="histdata_overview"/>, as well as join data returned by a method, script or UDF invocation as outlined in <xref linkend="joining_method"/>.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The keywords <literal>left, right, full</literal> and <literal>inner</literal> control the type of the join between two streams. The optional <literal>on</literal> clause specifies one or more properties that join each stream. The synopsis is as follows:
			</para>

<synopsis>...from <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> [as name] 
  ((left|right|full outer) | inner) join <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> 
  [on <emphasis>property</emphasis> = <emphasis>property</emphasis> [and <emphasis>property</emphasis> = <emphasis>property</emphasis> ...] ]
  [ ((left|right|full outer) | inner) join <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> [on ...]]...
</synopsis>

			<para>
				If the outer join is a left outer join, there will be at least one output event for each event of the stream on the left-hand side of the clause. For example, in the left outer join shown below you get output for each event in the stream RfidEvent, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream OrderList.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent#time(30 sec) as rfid
       left outer join
       OrderList#length(10000) as orderlist
     on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>
		
			<para>
				Similarly, if the join is a Right Outer Join, then there will be at least one output event for each event of the stream on the right-hand side of the clause. For example, in the right outer join shown below you get output for each event in the stream OrderList, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream RfidEvent.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent#time(30 sec) as rfid
       right outer join
       OrderList#length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				For all types of outer joins, if the join condition is not met, the select list is computed with the event properties of the arrived event while all other event properties are considered to be null.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The next type of outer join is a full outer join. In a full outer join, each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, one or more output events are produced. In the example below, when either an RfidEvent or an OrderList event arrive, one or more output event is produced. The next example shows a full outer join that joins on multiple properties:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent#time(30 sec) as rfid
       full outer join
       OrderList#length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId and rfid.assetId = orderList.assetId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The last type of join is an inner join. In an inner join, the engine produces at least one output event for each event of the stream on the left-hand side that matches at least one event on the right hand side considering the join properties. For example, in the inner join shown below you get output for each event in the RfidEvent stream that matches one or more events in the OrderList data window:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent#time(30 sec) as rfid
       inner join
       OrderList#length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId and rfid.assetId = orderList.assetId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Patterns as streams in a join follow this rule: If your query does not specify a data window for the pattern then the pattern stream retains the last match. Thus a pattern must have matched at least once for the last match to become available in a join. Multiple rows from a pattern stream may be retained by declaring a data window onto a pattern using the <literal>pattern [...]#</literal><emphasis>window_spec</emphasis> syntax.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				This example outer joins multiple streams. Here the RfidEvent stream is outer joined to both ProductName and LocationDescription via left outer join:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent#time(30 sec) as rfid
      left outer join ProductName#keepall as refprod
        on rfid.productId = refprod.prodId
      left outer join LocationDescription#keepall as refdesc
        on rfid.location = refdesc.locId]]></programlisting>
        
			<para>
			  If the optional <literal>on</literal> clause is specified, it may only employ the <literal>=</literal> equals operator and property names. Any other operators must be placed in the <literal>where</literal>-clause.
			  The stream names that appear in the <literal>on</literal> clause may refer to any stream in the <literal>from</literal>-clause.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			  Your EPL may also provide no <literal>on</literal> clause. This is useful when the streams that are joined do not provide any properties to join on, for example when joining with a time-based pattern. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example employs a unidirectional left outer join such that the engine, every 10 seconds, outputs a count of the number of RfidEvent events in the 60-second time window.
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select count(*) from
  pattern[every timer:interval(1)] unidirectional

			<para>
				In a join or outer join your statement lists multiple event streams, data windows and/or patterns in the <literal>from</literal> clause. As events arrive into the engine, each of the streams (data windows, patterns) provides insert and remove stream events. The engine evaluates each insert and remove stream event provided by each stream, and joins or outer joins each event against data window contents of each stream, and thus generates insert and remove stream join results.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The direction of the join execution depends on which stream or streams are currently providing an insert or remove stream event for executing the join. 
				A join is thus multidirectional, or bidirectional when only two streams are joined.
				A join can be made unidirectional if your application does not want new results when events arrive on a given stream or streams.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword can be used in the <literal>from</literal> clause to identify streams that provide the events to execute the join. If the keyword is present for a stream, all other streams in the <literal>from</literal> clause become passive streams. When events arrive or leave a data window of a passive stream then the join does not generate join results. 
			</para>
	
			<para>
				For example, consider a use case that requires us to join stock tick events (TickEvent) and news events (NewsEvent). The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword allows to generate results only when TickEvent events arrive, and not when NewsEvent arrive or leave the 10-second time window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent unidirectional, NewsEvent#time(10 sec) 
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Aggregation functions in a <literal>unidirectional</literal> join aggregate within the context of each unidirectional event evaluation and are not cumulative. Thereby aggregation functions when used with <literal>unidirectional</literal> may evaluate faster as they do not need to consider a remove stream (data removed from data windows or named windows).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The count function in the next query returns, for each TickEvent, the number of matching NewEvent events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select count(*) from TickEvent unidirectional, NewsEvent#time(10 sec) 
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The following restrictions apply to unidirectional joins:
			</para>
	
			<orderedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword can only be specified for a single stream in the <literal>from</literal> clause, unless all streams are in a full outer join and all streams declare <literal>unidirectional</literal>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>

			<title>Hints Related to Joins</title>			
			<para>
				When joining 3 or more streams (including any relational or non-relational sources as below) it can sometimes help to provide the query planner instructions how to best execute the join. The engine compiles a query plan for the EPL statement at statement creation time. You can output the query plan to logging (see configuration).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				An outer join that specifies only <literal>inner</literal> keywords for all streams is equivalent to an default (inner) join. The following two statements are equivalent:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent#lastevent, 
    NewsEvent#lastevent where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Equivalent to:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent#lastevent 
	inner join NewsEvent#lastevent on tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				For all types of joins, the query planner determines a query graph: The term is used here for all the information regarding what properties or expressions are used to join the streams. The query graph thus includes the where-clause expressions as well as outer-join on-clauses if this statement is an outer join. The query planner also computes a dependency graph which includes information about all historical data streams (relational and non-relational as below) and their input needs. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For default (inner) joins the query planner first attempts to find a path of execution as a nested iteration. For each stream the query planner selects the best order of streams available for the nested iteration considering the query graph and dependency graph. If the full depth of the join is achievable via nested iteration for all streams without full table scan then the query planner uses that nested iteration plan. If not, then the query planner re-plans considering a merge join (Cartesian) approach instead.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Specify the @Hint('prefer_merge_join') to instruct the query planner to prefer a merge join plan instead of a nested iteration plan. Specify the @Hint('force_nested_iter') to instruct the query planner to always use a nested iteration plan. 
			</para>

			<para>
				For example, consider the below statement. Depending on the number of matching rows in OrderBookOne and OrderBookTwo (named windows in this example, and assumed to be defined elsewhere) the performance of the join may be better using the merge join plan.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[@Hint('prefer_merge_join') 
select * from TickEvent#lastevent t, 
	OrderBookOne ob1, OrderBookOne ob2
where ob1.symbol = t.symbol and ob2.symbol = t.symbol 
and ob1.price between t.buy and t.sell and ob2.price between t.buy and t.sell]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				For outer joins the query planner considers nested iteration and merge join (Cartesian) equally and above hints don't apply.

		<para>
			This chapter outlines how reference data and historical data that are stored in a relational database can be queried via SQL within EPL statements. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Esper can access via join and outer join as well as via iterator (poll) API all types of event streams to stored data. In order for such data sources to become accessible to Esper, some configuration is required. The <xref linkend="config-database-ref"/> explains the required configuration for database access in greater detail, and includes information on configuring a query result cache.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Esper does not parse or otherwise inspect your SQL query. Therefore your SQL can make use of any database-specific SQL language extensions or features that your database provides.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you have enabled query result caching in your Esper database configuration, Esper retains SQL query results in cache following the configured cache eviction policy. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Also if you have enabled query result caching in your Esper database configuration and provide EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and/or <literal>on</literal> clause (outer join) expressions, then 
			Esper builds indexes on the SQL query results to enable fast lookup. This is especially useful if your queries return a large number of rows. For building the proper indexes, Esper inspects the expression found in your EPL query <literal>where</literal> clause, if present. For outer joins, Esper also inspects your EPL query <literal>on</literal> clause. Esper analyzes the EPL <literal>on</literal> clause and <literal>where</literal> clause expressions, if present, looking for property comparison with or without logical AND-relationships between properties. When a SQL query returns rows for caching, Esper builds and caches the appropriate index and lookup strategies for fast row matching against indexes.
		</para>

		<para>
			Joins or outer joins in which only SQL statements or method, script and UDF invocations are listed in the <literal>from</literal> clause and no other event streams are termed <emphasis>passive</emphasis> joins. A passive join does not produce an insert or remove stream and therefore does not invoke statement listeners with results. A passive join can be iterated on (polled) using a statement's <literal>safeIterator</literal> and <literal>iterator</literal> methods.
		</para>

			<title>Joining SQL Query Results</title>
			
			<para>
				To join an event stream against stored data, specify the <literal>sql</literal> keyword followed by the name of the database and a parameterized SQL query. The syntax to use in the <literal>from</literal> clause of an EPL statement is:
			</para>
	
			<synopsis>sql:<emphasis>database_name</emphasis> [" <emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis> "]</synopsis>
	
			<para>
				The engine uses the <emphasis>database_name</emphasis> identifier to obtain configuration information in order to establish a database connection, as well as settings that control connection creation and removal. Please see <xref linkend="config-database-ref"/> to configure an engine for database access.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				Following the database name is the SQL query to execute. The SQL query can contain one or more substitution parameters. The SQL query string is placed in single brackets <literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal>. The SQL query can be placed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). The SQL query grammer is passed to your database software unchanged, allowing you to write any SQL query syntax that your database understands, including stored procedure calls.
			</para>

			<para>
				Substitution parameters in the SQL query string take the form <literal>${</literal><emphasis>expression</emphasis><literal>}</literal>. The engine resolves <emphasis>expression</emphasis> at statement execution time to the actual expression result by evaluating the events in the joined event stream or current variable values, if any event property references or variables occur in the expression. An <emphasis>expression</emphasis> may not contain EPL substitution parameters.
			</para>

			<para>
				The engine determines the type of the SQL query output columns by means of the result set metadata that your database software returns for the statement. The actual 
				query results are obtained via the <literal>getObject</literal> on <literal>java.sql.ResultSet</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL statement below joins an event stream consisting of <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> events with the results of an SQL query against the database named <literal>MyCustomerDB</literal> and table <literal>Customer</literal>: 
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select custId, cust_name from CustomerCallEvent,
  sql:MyCustomerDB [' select cust_name from Customer where cust_id = ${custId} ']]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The example above assumes that <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> supplies an event property named <literal>custId</literal>. The SQL query selects the customer name from the Customer table. The <literal>where</literal> clause in the SQL matches the Customer table column <literal>cust_id</literal> with the value of <literal>custId</literal> in each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> event. The engine executes the SQL query for each new <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> encountered.
			</para>

			<para>
				If the SQL query returns no rows for a given customer id, the engine generates no output event. Else the engine generates one output event for each row returned by the SQL query. An outer join as described in the next section can be used to control whether the engine should generate output events even when the SQL query returns no rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example adds a time window of 30 seconds to the event stream <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal>. It also renames the selected properties to customerName and customerId to demonstrate how the naming of columns in an SQL query can be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause in the EPL query. And the example uses explicit stream names via the <literal>as</literal> keyword.
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select customerId, customerName from
  CustomerCallEvent#time(30 sec) as cce,
  sql:MyCustomerDB ["select cust_id as customerId, cust_name as customerName from Customer 
                  where cust_id = ${cce.custId}"] as cq]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Any window, such as the time window, generates insert stream (istream) events as events enter the window, and remove stream (rstream) events as events leave the window. The engine executes the given SQL query for each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> in both the insert stream and the remove stream. As a performance optimization, the <literal>istream</literal> or <literal>rstream</literal> keywords in the <literal>select</literal> clause can be used to instruct the engine to only join insert stream or remove stream events, reducing the number of SQL query executions.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Since any expression may be placed within the <literal>${...}</literal> syntax, you may use variables or user-defined functions as well.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example assumes that a variable by name <literal>varLowerLimit</literal> is defined and that a user-defined function <literal>getLimit</literal> exists on the <literal>MyLib</literal> imported class that takes a <literal>LimitEvent</literal> as a parameter:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from LimitEvent le, 
  sql:MyCustomerDB [' select cust_name from Customer where 
      amount > ${max(varLowerLimit, MyLib.getLimit(le))} ']]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The example above takes the higher of the current variable value or the value returned by the user-defined function to return only those customer names where the amount exceeds the computed limit.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 xml:id="histdata_join_where" revision="1">
			<title>SQL Query and the EPL <literal>Where</literal> Clause</title>
			
			<para>
				Consider using the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause to join the SQL query result to your event stream. Similar to EPL joins and outer-joins that join event streams or patterns, the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause provides join criteria between the SQL query results and the event stream (as a side note, an SQL <literal>where</literal> clause is a filter of rows executed by your database on your database server before returning SQL query results).
			</para>

			<para>
				Esper analyzes the expression in the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause, if present, and builds the appropriate indexes from that information at runtime, to ensure fast matching of event stream events to SQL query results, even if your SQL query returns a large number of rows. Your applications must ensure to configure a cache for your database using Esper configuration, as such indexes are held with regular data in a cache. If you application does not enable caching of SQL query results, the engine does not build indexes on cached data.
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL statement below joins an event stream consisting of <literal>OrderEvent</literal> events with the results of an SQL query against the database named <literal>MyRefDB</literal> and table <literal>SymbolReference</literal>: 
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, symbolDesc from OrderEvent as orders,
  sql:MyRefDB ['select symbolDesc from SymbolReference'] as reference
  where reference.symbol = orders.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Notice how the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause joins the <literal>OrderEvent</literal> stream to the <literal>SymbolReference</literal> table. In this example, the SQL query itself does not have a SQL <literal>where</literal> clause 
				and therefore returns all rows from table <literal>SymbolReference</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your application enables caching, the SQL query fires only at the arrival of the first <literal>OrderEvent</literal> event. When the second <literal>OrderEvent</literal> arrives, the join execution uses the cached query result. If the caching policy that you specified in the Esper database configuration evicts the SQL query result from cache, then the engine fires the SQL query again to obtain a new result and places the result in cache.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				If SQL result caching is enabled and your EPL <literal>where</literal> clause, as show in the above example, provides the properties to join, then the engine indexes the SQL query results in cache and retains the index together with the query result in cache. Thus your application can benefit from high performance index-based lookups as long as the SQL query results are found in cache. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The SQL result caches operate on the level of all result rows for a given parameter set. For example, if your query returns 10 rows for a certain set of parameter values then the cache treats all 10 rows as a single entry keyed by the parameter values, and the expiry policy applies to all 10 rows and not to each individual row.
			</para>

			<para>
				It is also possible to join multiple autonomous database systems in a single query, for example:
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, symbolDesc from OrderEvent as orders,
  sql:My_Oracle_DB ['select symbolDesc from SymbolReference'] as reference,
  sql:My_MySQL_DB ['select orderList from orderHistory'] as history
  where reference.symbol = orders.symbol
  and history.symbol = orders.symbol ]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 xml:id="histdata_outerjoin" revision="1">
			<title>Outer Joins With SQL Queries</title>

			<para>
				You can use outer joins to join data obtained from an SQL query and control when an event is produced. Use a left outer join, such as in the next statement, if you need an output event for each event regardless of whether or not the SQL query returns rows. If the SQL query returns no rows, the join result populates null values into the selected properties.
			</para>
						
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select custId, custName from
  CustomerCallEvent as cce
  left outer join 
  sql:MyCustomerDB ["select cust_id, cust_name as custName 
                     from Customer where cust_id = ${cce.custId}"] as cq
  on cce.custId = cq.cust_id]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The statement above always generates at least one output event for each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal>, containing all columns selected by the SQL query, even if the SQL query does not return any rows. Note the <literal>on</literal> expression that is required for outer joins. The <literal>on</literal> acts as an additional filter to rows returned by the SQL query.

			</para>

				The next statement is an example that shows a pattern that fires every 5 seconds to query the NewOrder table for new orders:

			</para>
						
			<para>
				Your EPL statement can specify an SQL statement without a join. Such a stand-alone SQL statement does not post new events, and may only be queried via the <literal>iterator</literal> poll API. Your EPL and SQL statement may still use variables.

			<title>Oracle Drivers and No-Metadata Workaround</title>

			<para>
			   Certain JDBC database drivers are known to not return metadata for precompiled prepared SQL statements. This can be a problem as metadata is required by Esper. Esper obtains SQL result set metadata to validate an EPL statement and to provide column types for output events. JDBC drivers that do not provide metadata for precompiled SQL statements require a workaround. Such drivers do generally provide metadata for executed SQL statements, however do not provide the metadata for precompiled SQL statements.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Please consult the <xref linkend="configuration"/> for the configuration options available in relation to metadata retrieval.
			</para>

			<para>
				To obtain metadata for an SQL statement, Esper can alternatively fire a SQL statement which returns the same column names and types as the actual SQL statement but without returning any rows. This kind of SQL statement is referred to as a <emphasis>sample</emphasis> statement in below workaround description. The engine can then use the sample SQL statement to retrieve metadata for the column names and types returned by the actual SQL statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				Applications can provide a sample SQL statement to retrieve metadata via the <literal>metadatasql</literal> keyword:
			</para>
			<synopsis>sql:<emphasis>database_name</emphasis> ["<emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis>" metadatasql "<emphasis>sql_meta_query</emphasis>"] </synopsis>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>sql_meta_query</emphasis> must be an SQL statement that returns the same number of columns, the same type of columns and the same column names as the 
				<emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis>, and does not return any rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				Alternatively, applications can choose not to provide an explicit sample SQL statement. If the EPL statement does not use the <literal>metadatasql</literal> syntax, the engine applies lexical analysis to the SQL statement. From the lexical analysis Esper generates a sample SQL statement adding a restrictive clause "where 1=0"  to the SQL statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				Alternatively, you can add the following tag to the SQL statement: <literal>${$ESPER-SAMPLE-WHERE}</literal>. If the tag  exists in the SQL statement, the engine does not perform lexical analysis and simply replaces the 
				tag with the SQL <literal>where</literal> clause "where 1=0". Therefore this workaround is applicable to SQL statements that cannot be correctly lexically analyzed. The SQL text after the placeholder is not part of the sample query. For example:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select mycol from sql:myDB [
  'select mycol from mytesttable ${$ESPER-SAMPLE-WHERE} where ....'], ...]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				If your <emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis> SQL query contains vendor-specific SQL syntax, generation of the metadata query may fail to produce a valid SQL statement. If you experience an SQL error while fetching metadata, use any of the above workarounds with the Oracle JDBC driver.

			<para>
				The <literal>method</literal> keyword denotes a method, script or UDF invocation. It is followed by an optional class or variable name.
				The <emphasis>method_script_udf_name</emphasis> is the name of the method, script or user-defined function.
				If you have parameters to your method, script or UDF invocation, these are placed in 
				parentheses after the method or script name. Any expression is allowed as a parameter, and individual parameter expressions are separated by a comma. 
				Expressions may also use event properties of the joined stream.

			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from AssetMoveEvent, method:MyLookupLib.lookupAsset(assetId)]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The following statement demonstrates the use of the <literal>where</literal> clause to join events to the rows returned by an invocation, which in this example does not take parameters:

			<para>
				Your method, scipt or UDF invocation may return zero, one or many rows for each invocation. If you have caching enabled through configuration, then Esper can avoid the invocation and instead use cached results. Similar to SQL joins, Esper also indexes cached result rows such that join operations based on the <literal>where</literal> clause or outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause can be very efficient, especially if your invocation returns a large number of rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				If the time taken by method, script or UDF invocations is critical to your application, you may configure local caches as <xref linkend="config-method-invocations"/> describes.

			<para>
				Esper analyzes the expression in the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause, if present, and builds the appropriate indexes from that information at runtime, to ensure fast matching of event stream events to invocation results, even if your invocation returns a large number of rows. Your applications must ensure to configure a cache for your invocation using Esper configuration, as such indexes are held with regular data in a cache. If you application does not enable caching of invocation results, the engine does not build indexes on cached data.

			  <programlisting><![CDATA[create schema Bar() inherits Foo]]></programlisting>

			  <para>
			      Following above schema,  Foo is a supertype or Bar and therefore any Bar event also fulfills Foo and matches where Foo matches. An EPL statement such as <literal>select * from Foo</literal> 
			      returns any Foo event as well as any event that is a subtype of Foo such as all Bar events. When your EPL queries don't use any Foo events there is no cost, thus <literal>inherits</literal> is 
			      generally an effective way to share properties between types. The start and end timestamp are also inherited from any supertype that has the timestamp property names defined.
			  </para>

			  <para>
				  The optional <literal>copyfrom</literal> keyword is for defining a schema based on another schema. This keyword causes the engine to copy property definitions: There is no inherits, extends, supertype or subtype relationship between the types listed.

[output first | all]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that trigger the split stream. It is optionally
followed by <emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis> which are filter expressions to apply to arriving events. The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword
can be used to assign a stream name. Patterns and named windows can also be specified in the <literal>on</literal> clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			Following the <literal>on</literal>-clause is one or more <emphasis>insert into</emphasis> clauses as described in <xref linkend="epl-insert-into"/> and <emphasis>select</emphasis> clauses as described in <xref linkend="epl-select-list"/>. 
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The second and subsequent <literal>insert into</literal> and <literal>select</literal> clause pair can have a <literal>from</literal> clause for <emphasis>contained-event-selection</emphasis>. 
			This is useful when your trigger events themselves contain events that must be processed individually and that may be delimited by marker events that you can define.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Each <literal>select</literal> clause may be followed by a <literal>where</literal> clause containing a condition. If the condition is true for the event, the engine transforms the event according to the <literal>select</literal> clause and inserts it into the corresponding stream.
		</para>

		<para>
			At the end of the statement can be an optional <literal>output</literal> clause. By default the engine inserts into the first stream for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches if one was specified, starting from the top. If you specify the <literal>output all</literal> keywords, then the engine inserts into each stream (not only the first stream) for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches or that do not have a <literal>where</literal> clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			If, for a given event, none of the <literal>where</literal> clause conditions match, the statement listener receives the unmatched event. The statement listener only receives unmatched events and does not receive any transformed or inserted events. The <literal>iterator</literal> method to the statement returns no events.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			You may specify an optional context name to the effect that the split-stream operates according to the context dimensional information as declared for the context. See <xref linkend="context"/> for more information.
		</para>

		<para>
			In the below sample statement, the engine inserts each <literal>OrderEvent</literal> into the <literal>LargeOrders</literal> stream if the order quantity is 100 or larger, or into the <literal>SmallOrders</literal> stream if the order quantity is smaller then 100:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent

  insert into MediumOrders select orderId, customer where orderQty between 20 and 100
  insert into SmallOrders select orderId, customer where orderQty > 0]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			As you may have noticed in the above statement, orders that have an order quantity of zero don't match any of the conditions. The engine does not insert such order events into any stream and the listener to the statement receives these unmatched events.
		</para>

		<para>
			By default the engine inserts into the first <literal>insert into</literal> stream without a <literal>where</literal> clause or for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches. To change the default behavior and insert into all matching streams instead (including those without a <literal>where</literal> clause), add the <literal>output all</literal> keywords.
		</para>

		<para>
			The sample statement below shows the use of the <literal>output all</literal> keywords. The statement populates both the <literal>LargeOrders</literal> stream with large orders as well as the <literal>VIPCustomerOrders</literal> stream with orders for certain customers based on customer id:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent

  insert into VIPCustomerOrders select * where customerId in (1001, 1002)
  output all]]></programlisting>
  
	  <para>
		  Since the <literal>output all</literal> keywords are present, the above statement inserts each order event into either both streams or only one stream or none of the streams, depending on order quantity and customer id of the order event. The statement delivers order events not inserted into any of the streams to the listeners and/or subscriber to the statement.

			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent
  insert into OrderBeginEvent select orderId
  insert into OrderItemEvent select * from [select orderId, * from items]
  insert into OrderEndEvent select orderId
  output all]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				When an <literal>OrderEvent</literal> comes in, the engine first processes an <literal>OrderBeginEvent</literal>. The engine unpacks the order event and for each
				order item processes an <literal>OrderItemEvent</literal> containing the respective item. The engine last processes an <literal>OrderEndEvent</literal>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Such begin and end marker events are useful to initiate and terminate an analysis using context declaration, for example.

			A <emphasis>variable</emphasis> is a scalar, object, event or set of aggregation values that is available for use in all statements including patterns. Variables can be used in an expression anywhere in a statement as well as in the <literal>output</literal> clause for output rate limiting.
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Variables must first be declared or configured before use, by defining each variable's type and name. Variables can be created via the <literal>create variable</literal> syntax or declared by runtime or static configuration. Variables can be assigned new values by using the <literal>on set</literal> syntax or via the <literal>setVariableValue</literal> methods on <literal>EPRuntime</literal>. The <literal>EPRuntime</literal> also provides method to read variable values.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		  A variable can be declared constant. A constant variable always has the initial value and cannot be assigned a new value. A constant variable can be used like any other variable and can be used wherever a constant is required. By declaring a variable constant you enable the Esper engine to 
		  optimize and perform query planning knowing that the variable value cannot change.
		</para>

		<para>
			When declaring a class-typed, event-typed or aggregation-typed variable you may read or set individual properties within the same variable.
		</para>

		<para>
			 The engine guarantees consistency and atomicity of variable reads and writes on the level of context partition (this is a soft guarantee, see below). Variables are optimized for fast read access and are also multithread-safe.

		<para>
			 When you associate a context to the variable then each context partition maintains its own variable value. See <xref linkend="context_variables"/> for more information.

			<para>
				The engine softly guarantees consistency and atomicity of variables when your statement executes in response to an event or timer invocation. Variables acquire a stable value (implemented by versioning) when your statement starts executing in response to an event or timer invocation, and variables do not change value during execution. When one or more variable values are updated via <literal>on set</literal> statements, the changes to all updated variables become visible to statements as one unit and only when the <literal>on set</literal> statement completes successfully.
			</para>

			<para>
				The atomicity and consistency guarantee is a soft guarantee. If any of your application statements, in response to an event or timer invocation, execute for a time interval longer then 15 seconds (default interval length), then the engine may use current variable values after 15 seconds passed, rather then then-current variable values at the time the statement started executing in response to an event or timer invocation.				
			</para>

			<para>
				The length of the time interval that variable values are held stable for the duration of execution of a given statement is by default 15 seconds, but can be configured via engine default settings.

			<title>Class and Event-Type Variables</title>

			<para>
				The <literal>create variable</literal> syntax and the API accept a fully-qualified class name or alternatively the name of an event type. This is useful when you want a single variable to have multiple property values to read or set.
			</para>

			<para>
			  The next statement assumes that the event type <literal>PageHitEvent</literal> is declared:

			<programlisting><![CDATA[// You may assign the complete event
on PageHitEvent(ip='0.0.0.0') pagehit set varPageHitZero = pagehit]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// Or assign individual properties of the event
on PageHitEvent(ip='0.0.0.0') pagehit set varPageHitZero.userId = pagehit.userId]]></programlisting>

				A variable that represents a service for calling instance methods could be initialized by calling a factory method. This example assumes the classes were added to imports:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create constant variable StateCheckerService stateChecker = StateCheckerServiceFactory.makeService()]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				You can add a variable via the configuration API; an example code snippet is next:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[admin.getConfiguration().addVariable("stateChecker", StateCheckerService.class, StateCheckerServiceFactory.makeService(), true);]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Application objects can also be passed via transient configuration information as described in <xref linkend="configuration-transientobjects"/>.
			</para>

			<note>
				When using non-constant class or event-type variables and when your EPL intends to set property values on the variable itself (i.e. <literal>set varPageHitZero.userId</literal>), please note the following requirements. In order for the engine to assign property values, the underlying event type must allow writing property values. If using JavaBean event classes the class must have setter methods and a default constructor. The underlying event type must also be copy-able i.e. implement <literal>Serializable</literal> or configure a copy method (only for non-constant variables and when setting property values).

	   <title>Contained-Event Selection</title>
	   
		<para>
			Contained-event selection is for use when an event contains properties that are themselves events, or more generally when your application needs to split an event into multiple events. One example is when application events are coarse-grained structures and you need to perform bulk operations on the rows of the property graph in an event.
		</para>

		<para>
			Use the contained-event selection syntax in a filter expression such as in a pattern, <literal>from</literal> clause, subselect, on-select and on-delete. This section provides the synopsis and examples.
		</para>

		<para>
			To review, in the <literal>from</literal> clause a <emphasis>contained_selection</emphasis> may appear after the event stream name and filter criteria, and before any data windows.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis for <emphasis>contained_selection</emphasis> is as follows:
		</para>
		<synopsis>[select <emphasis>select_expressions</emphasis> from] 
  <emphasis>contained_expression</emphasis> [@type(<emphasis>eventtype_name</emphasis>)] [as <emphasis>alias_name</emphasis>]
  [where <emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis>]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause and <emphasis>select_expressions</emphasis> are optional and may be used to select specific properties of contained events.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <emphasis>contained_expression</emphasis> is required and returns individual events. The expression can, for example, be an event property name that returns an event fragment, i.e. a property that can itself be represented as an event by the underlying event representation. The expression can also be any other expression such as a single-row function or a script that returns either an array or a <literal>java.util.Collection</literal> of events. Simple values such as integer or string are not fragments but can be used as well as described below.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		    Provide the <literal>@type(name)</literal> annotation after the contained expression to name the event type of events returned by the expression. The annotation is optional and not needed when the contained-expression is an event property that returns a class or other event fragment.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The <emphasis>alias_name</emphasis> can be provided to assign a name to the expression result value rows.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>where</literal> clause and <emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis> is optional and may be used to filter out properties.
		</para>

		<para>
			As an example event, consider a media order. A media order consists of order items as well as product descriptions. A media order event can be represented as an object graph (POJO event representation), or a structure of nested Maps (Map event representation) or a XML document (XML DOM or Axiom event representation) or other custom plug-in event representation.
		</para>

		<para>
			To illustrate, a sample media order event in XML event representation is shown below. Also, a XML event type can optionally be strongly-typed with an explicit XML XSD schema that is not shown here. Note that Map and POJO representation can be considered equivalent for the purpose of this example.
		</para>

      <author>Isaac Asimov</author>
    </book>
  </books>
</mediaorder>]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The next query utilizes the contained-event selection syntax to return each book:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MediaOrder[books.book]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The result of the above query is one event per book. Output events contain only the book properties and not any of the mediaorder-level properties.
		</para>

		<para>
			Note that, when using listeners, the engine delivers multiple results in one invocation of each listener. Therefore listeners to the above statement can expect a single invocation passing all book events within one media order event as an array.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			 To better illustrate the position of the contained-event selection syntax in a statement, consider the next two queries:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MediaOrder(orderId='PO200901')[books.book]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The above query the returns each book only for media orders with a given order id. This query illustrates a contained-event selection and a data window: 
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select count(*) from MediaOrder[books.book]#unique(bookId)]]></programlisting>
		
		<para>
			The sample above counts each book unique by book id.
		</para>

		<para>
			Contained-event selection can be staggered. When staggering multiple contained-event selections the staggered contained-event selection is relative to its parent.
		</para>

		<para>
			This example demonstrates staggering contained-event selections by selecting each review of each book:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MediaOrder[books.book][review]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Listeners to the query above receive a row for each review of each book. Output events contain only the review properties and not the book or media order properties.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The following is not valid:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// not valid
select * from MediaOrder[books.book.review]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>book</literal> property in an indexed property (an array or collection) and thereby requires an index in order to determine which book to use. The expression <literal>books.book[1].review</literal> is valid and means all reviews of the second (index 1) book.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The contained-event selection syntax is part of the filter expression and may therefore occur in patterns and anywhere a filter expression is valid. 
		</para>

		<para>
			A pattern example is below. The example assumes that a <literal>Cancel</literal> event type has been defined that also has an <literal>orderId</literal> property:
		</para>
		<programlisting>select * from pattern [c=Cancel -&gt; books=MediaOrder(orderId = c.orderId)[books.book] ]</programlisting>
	
		<para>
			When used in a pattern, a filter with a contained-event selection returns an array of events, similar to the match-until clause in patterns. The above statement returns, in the <literal>books</literal> property, an
			array of book events.

As has been discussed as part of the <literal>select</literal> clause, the wildcard (<literal>*</literal>) and <emphasis>property_alias</emphasis><literal>.*</literal> do not copy properties for performance reasons. The wildcard syntax instead specifies the underlying type, and additional properties are added onto that underlying type if required.

	   <title>Updating an Insert Stream: The <literal>Update IStream</literal> Clause</title>
	   
		<para>
			The <literal>update istream</literal> statement allows declarative modification of event properties of events entering a stream. Update is a pre-processing step to each new event, modifying an event before the event applies to any statements.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis of <literal>update istream</literal> is as follows:
		</para>

		<synopsis>update istream <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
  set <emphasis>property_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>set_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>property_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>set_expression</emphasis>] [,...]
  [where <emphasis>where_expression</emphasis>]
</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that the <literal>update</literal> applies to.
			The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword can be used to assign a name to the event type for use with subqueries, for example.
			Following the <literal>set</literal> keyword is a comma-separated list of property names and expressions that provide the event properties to change and values to set.
		</para>

		<para>
			The optional <literal>where</literal> clause and expression can be used to filter out events to which to apply updates.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Listeners to an <literal>update</literal> statement receive the updated event in the insert stream (new data) and the event prior to the update in the remove stream (old data). Note that if there are multiple update statements that all apply to the same event then the engine will ensure that the output events delivered to listeners or subscribers are consistent with the then-current updated properties of the event (if necessary making event copies, as described below, in the case that listeners are attached to update statements). Iterating over an update statement returns no events.
		</para>

		<para>
			As an example, the below statement assumes an <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event type that has properties named <literal>severity</literal> and <literal>reason</literal>:
		</para>
		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream AlertEvent 
  set severity = 'High'
  where severity = 'Medium' and reason like '%withdrawal limit%']]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The statement above changes the value of the <literal>severity</literal> property to "High" for <literal>AlertEvent</literal> events that have a medium severity and contain a specific reason text.
		</para>

		<para>
			Update statements apply the changes to event properties before other statements receive the event(s) for processing, e.g. "<literal>select * from AlertEvent</literal>" receives the updated <literal>AlertEvent</literal>. This is true regardless of the order in which your application creates statements.
		</para>

		<para>
			When multiple update statements apply to the same event, the engine executes updates in the order in which update statements are created. We recommend the <literal>@Priority</literal> EPL annotation to define a deterministic order of processing updates, especially in the case where update statements get created and destroyed dynamically or multiple update statements update the same fields. The update statement with the highest <literal>@Priority</literal> value applies last.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>update</literal> clause can be used on streams populated via <literal>insert into</literal>, as this example utilizing a pattern demonstrates:
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into DoubleWithdrawalStream 
select a.id, b.id, a.account as account, 0 as minimum 
from pattern [a=Withdrawal -> b=Withdrawal(id = a.id)]]]></programlisting>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream DoubleWithdrawalStream set minimum = 1000 where account in (10002, 10003)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			When using <literal>update istream</literal> with named windows, any changes to event properties apply before an event enters the named window.
			The <literal>update istream</literal> is not available for tables.
		</para>

		<para>
			Consider the next example (shown here with statement names in @Name EPL annotation, multiple EPL statements):
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[@Name("CreateWindow") create window MyWindow#time(30 sec) as AlertEvent

@Name("UpdateStream") update istream MyWindow set severity = 'Low' where reason = '%out of paper%'

@Name("InsertWindow") insert into MyWindow select * from AlertEvent

@Name("SelectWindow") select * from MyWindow]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>UpdateStream</literal> statement specifies an <literal>update</literal> clause that applies to all events entering the named window. Note that <literal>update</literal> does not apply to events already in the named window at the time an application creates the <literal>UpdateStream</literal> statement, it only applies to new events entering the named window (after an application created the <literal>update</literal> statement).
		</para>

		<para>
			Therefore, in the above example listeners to the <literal>SelectWindow</literal> statement as well as the <literal>CreateWindow</literal> statement receive the updated event, 
			while listeners to the <literal>InsertWindow</literal> statement receive the original <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event (and not the updated event).
		</para>

		<para>
			Subqueries can also be used in all expressions including the optional <literal>where</literal> clause.
		</para>		

		<para>
			This example demonstrates a correlated subquery in an assignment expression and also demonstrates the optional <literal>as</literal> keyword. It assigns the <literal>phone</literal> property of an <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event a new value based on the lookup within all unique <literal>PhoneEvent</literal> events (according to an <literal>empid</literal> property) correlating the <literal>AlertEvent</literal> property <literal>reporter</literal> with the <literal>empid</literal> property of <literal>PhoneEvent</literal>:
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream AlertEvent as ae
  set phone = 
    (select phone from PhoneEvent#unique(empid) where empid = ae.reporter)]]></programlisting>
		
		<para>
			When updating indexed properties use the syntax <emphasis>propertyName</emphasis><literal>[</literal><emphasis>index</emphasis><literal>] = </literal><emphasis>value</emphasis> with the index value being an integer number. 
			When updating mapped properties use the syntax <emphasis>propertyName</emphasis><literal>(</literal><emphasis>key</emphasis><literal>) = </literal><emphasis>value</emphasis> with the key being a string value.
		</para>

		<sect2 xml:id="epl-update-object" revision="1">
			<title>Immutability and Updates</title>
	
			<para>
				When updating event objects the engine maintains consistency across statements. The engine ensures that an update to an event does not impact the results of statements that look for or retain the original un-updated event. 
				As a result the engine may need to copy an event object to maintain consistency.
			</para>

			<para>
				In the case your application utilizes Java objects as the underlying event representation and an <literal>update</literal> statement updates properties on an object, then in order to maintain consistency across statements 
				it is necessary for the engine to copy the object before changing properties (and thus not change the original object). 
			</para>

			<para>
				For Java application objects, the copy operation is implemented by serialization. Your event object must therefore implement the <literal>java.io.Serializable</literal> interface to become eligible for update. As an alternative to serialization, you may instead configure a copy method as part of the event type configuration via <literal>ConfigurationEventTypeLegacy</literal>.

		<title>Controlling Event Delivery : The <literal>For</literal> Clause</title>
		
		<para>
			The engine delivers all result events of a given statement to the statement's listeners and subscriber (if any) in a single invocation of each listener and subscriber's <literal>update</literal> method passing an array of result events. For example, a statement using a time-batch window may provide many result events after a time period passes, a pattern may provide multiple matching events or in a join the join cardinality could be multiple rows.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			For statements that typically post multiple result events to listeners the <literal>for</literal> keyword controls the number of invocations of the engine to listeners and subscribers and the subset of all result events delivered by each invocation. 
			This can be useful when your application listener or subscriber code expects multiple invocations or expects that invocations only receive events that belong together by some additional criteria.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>for</literal> keyword is a reserved keyword. It is followed by either the <literal>grouped_delivery</literal> keyword for grouped delivery or the <literal>discrete_delivery</literal> keyword for discrete delivery. The <literal>for</literal> clause is valid after any EPL select statement.

		<synopsis>... for grouped_delivery (<emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis>] [,...])</synopsis>
		
		<para>
			The <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> expression list provides one or more expressions to apply to result events. The engine invokes listeners and subscribers once for each distinct set of values returned by <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> expressions passing only the events for that group.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis for discrete delivery is as follows:
		</para>
		<synopsis>... for discrete_delivery</synopsis>

		<para>
			With discrete delivery the engine invokes listeners and subscribers once for each result event passing a single result event in each invocation.
